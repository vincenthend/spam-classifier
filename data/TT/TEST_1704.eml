{'body': 'URL: http://boingboing.net/#85497383\nDate: Not supplied\n\nThis is the headline of the month, possibly the year: "Doctors Grow Pig Teeth \nin Rat Intestines." Do we even need to read the story to understand it? It\'s \nlike a freaking _haiku_ of near-singularity, future-shocky wonderment! \n\n    U.S. doctors said on Thursday they have managed to grow living pig teeth in \n    rats, a feat of biotechnology that experts said could spark a dental \n    revolution. \n\n    Researchers at Boston\'s Forsyth Institute said their successful experiment \n    suggests the existence of dental stem cells, which could one day allow a \n    person to replace a lost tooth with an identical one grown from his or her \n    own cells. \n\n    "The ability to identify, isolate and propagate dental stem cells to use in \n    biological replacement tooth therapy has the potential to revolutionize \n    dentistry," said Dominick DePaola, president and CEO of the institute that \n    focuses on oral and facial science.  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Dave[3]!_)\n\n[1] http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&ncid=585&e=1&cid=585&u=/nm/20020926/sc_nm/health_teeth_dc\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/88cUs6CumjiX\n[3] http://www.remtullaeurorscg.com\n\n\n', 'subject': "Rats' intestines and pigs' teeth"}
