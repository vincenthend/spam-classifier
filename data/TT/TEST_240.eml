{'body': 'URL: http://boingboing.net/#85483339\nDate: Not supplied\n\nTonight on the Style Network\'s TV show "Area," my house will be featured \nundergoing a Hawaiiana makeover. Watch it and meet Carla, my daughter, and me. \nIt\'ll play Monday at 9:30 pm ET. (If someone can tape it for me, I\'d appreciate \nit, because my cable service doesn\'t get the Style channel. I\'ll send you a new \nT-shirt iron on of a girl and her pet slug. Email mark@well.com.)
