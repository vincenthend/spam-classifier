Gabber, M. Jakobsson, Y. Matias, A. Mayer Bell\n\nin FC98.\n\nOnline copy here:\n\nhttp://citeseer.nj.nec.com/27735.html\n\n(Look in the view or download section at the top right, it\'s\navailabile in at least .pdf and .ps formats).\n\nThe framework they propose with proxies etc looks a lot like the\ncurrent camram architecture, with a proof of work to get on a white\nlist.  They use target revokable email addresses (basically identical\nto the LWPA concept) to implement the white list.\n\nThe resulting framework is essentially identical to what I proposed in\nrecent message with:\n\nSubject: target revokable email addresses, and postage-free tokens\n\nTheir idea of including the postage free-token in the email address,\nmirrors what is done in LWPA and makes the system exhibit smoother\nmigration for non-users.  eg. you can use varied sender addresses and\nit will still work, you can forward the email address to someone else\nand it will still work etc.\n\nThey have some software architecture diagrams and suggestions for\ninstalling some of the proxies on a corporate gateway -- "gatekeeper"\nthey call it.\n\nAdam\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: camram-spam-unsubscribe@camram.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: camram-spam-help@camram.org\n\n--- end forwarded text\n\n--- end forwarded text\n\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.
