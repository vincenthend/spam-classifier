What kind of port nomenclature is that? :-? \r\n\r\nI would expect "/dev/ttyUSB0" for an USB device or "/dev/ttyS0" for the \r\nfirst rs-232 port...\r\n\r\nI think the application is crashing because cannot establish a connection \r\nwith the device.\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\n\r\n-- \r\nCamale\xc3\xb3n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
