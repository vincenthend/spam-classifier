PDFLaTeX generally write bigger PDFs, simply\r\nbecause there is no compression (consider for example\r\nhttp://www.tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2004-June/005046.html). Moreover, I\r\nthink that psTricks does not work with PDFLaTeX (you need to use PDFTrick=\r\ns).\r\n\r\nI also vaguely remember about many situations where, if I had had to use\r\nPDFLaTeX, I would not have been able to produce the same document,\r\nbecause I would have had to change many packages which were incompatible.=\r\n\r\n\r\nYou might ask on comp.text.tex, this is a better place for this, because\r\nthis is my point of view, and it is not shared by the whole community.\r\n\r\n--=20\r\nMerciadri Luca\r\nSee http://www.student.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/~merciadri/\r\nI use PGP. If there is an incompatibility problem with your mail\r\nclient, please contact me.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstruction ends in the schoolroom, but education ends only with life.\r\n(F. W.
