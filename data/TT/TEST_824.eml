These all\nclaim no liability, no guarantees (M$ say delivered "with all faults", so\nat least they are honest).\n\n/Ciaran.\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users\' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: [ILUG] Interesting article on free software licences'}
