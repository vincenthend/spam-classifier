Apparently, this is normal. It appears \r\nthat the userspace battery utilities expect the battery to report mAh, \r\nbut in fact it reports percentage. This is either a bug in the battery \r\nfirmware or a bug in the BIOS; it is known to be fixed with newer BIOS \r\nversions and kernels \xe2\x89\xa5 2.6.25. \r\n***\r\n\r\nTHT.\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\n\r\n-- \r\nCamale\xc3\xb3n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
