Since I \nwouldn't have your alsa-kernel(??) installed, would that mean alsa-libs \nand so on won't install?\n\n(I guess, in short, if it *requires* the shipped kernel to be used, I'd \nbe against --with-alsa as a default?)\n\n-te\n\n-- \nTroy Engel, Systems Engineer\nCool as the other side of the pillow\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n", 'subject': 'Re: ALSA Problem with Null kernel'}
