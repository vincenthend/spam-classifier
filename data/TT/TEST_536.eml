{'body': 'I have a small bashscript which prepares a dual-monitor setup for my \r\nlaptop, since i\'m moving in and out of the office and meetings, I tend \r\nto attach and disconnect the monitor a few times a day.\r\n\r\nThat works fine with xrandr, but the issue is that I would like some \r\ngnome panels to move, and add one to the extra monitor. I have googled \r\naround but cant seemt o find that it would be possible, but it must be \r\nin some way, us usual. So, any hints?\r\n\r\nBasically, add one panel to one monitor, and add a window list to that \r\npanel.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n   Eric\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
