{'body': "Well, as many have said, it's non-trivial and not smart enough.\n\nI did try just cvs'ing over the existing sources, but cvs complained that my \nfiles were in the way.\n\nThen I thought that I'd only need the DRI stuff, that took about 1.5 hours to \nfetch 116M. Unfortunately I still need the XFree86 cvs stuff as well :-( At \n339M that took almost 3 hours.\n\nNow I can start building the XFree86 cvs and DRI cvs stuff for testing the 3D \npatches for my GVX1 card. I just hope I don't completely trash my system in \nthe process. \n\nThink I'll wait until morning to start building, though. I've been building a \nnew box from source this week. A 200Mhz PentiumMMX with 96M. It took a full \nday to build XFree86 4.2.0 and 2.5 days each to build qtlibs and kdelibs. \nkdebase took just under 46 hours. I've got lots of grief from the wife for \nthe computer running 'round the clock this week. The rest of KDE should build \nin under 20 hour increments.\n\nCheers,\n\n\tJohn Gay\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n", 'subject': 'Re: [ILUG] CVS question?'}
