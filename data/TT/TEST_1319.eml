Do you have trust in them?\r\n\r\n"Linux, FreeBSD, OSX and other OSs" all of them include their own \r\nlicencing model, whatever it is (closed or open sourced), so I can use \r\nthe software knowing beforehand what I can (or can\'t) do with it.\r\n\r\nThe licensing model of Flash was (very) unclear for me, that is what I \r\nmeant to say. And heck, it was recently "opened" (2008?) so it\'s a \r\nevolving license that could "dissolve" into something worse.\r\n\r\nDo not get me wrong, I\'m only saying that if I were a developer, I would \r\nhave many doubts in choosing a flash format for any of my works.\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\n\r\n-- \r\nCamale\xc3\xb3n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
