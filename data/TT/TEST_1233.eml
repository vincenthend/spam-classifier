That creates a new network place I can connect to.\r\n\r\nAfter that, I open the FTP session by providing credentials and copy a \r\nlocal file to remote FTP location and is stored fine, no error message or \r\nsomething that indicates the PUT operation has failed. \r\n\r\nThen, if I connect from another dedicated FTP client, I can see the new \r\nfile there, so all looks good. \r\n\r\nHave you tested with another FTP server?\r\n\r\nP.S. AFAIK, I don\'t have installed "gvfs-fuse".\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\n\r\n-- \r\nCamale\xc3\xb3n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
