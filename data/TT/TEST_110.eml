{'body': 'I was doing a search on some research papers on computer science and\nran across one of the most useful examples of public vertical search portals.\nhttp://hpsearch.uni-trier.de/hp/\n\nIt\'s the home pages of 62,179 computer scientists.\nMostly broken, but 50/50 on better title hits than DBLP.\n\nOne thing that\'s interesting is that for Google\'s\n"Similar Pages", only one homepage which returns the FoRK Archive is\nthe page below[1] Is he on FoRK.  Other similar pages\ninclude printer toner, home mortgages, and one for the origins of the\nprime radiant[2] which I found out is an Asmiov concept.\n\nThe concept of a prime radiant is that there\nis a single interconnected FoRKlist that ties a large number of\ndecentralized individuals throughout the world who\'s collective\nwisdom is a good model for predicint the future.\n\n\nGreg\n\n[1] http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~jfm/roberto.html\n[2] http://www.prime-radiant.com/primeorigins.html\n\n\n\nGreg\n\n-- \nGregory Alan Bolcer, CTO   | work: +1.949.833.2800 | gbolcer at endeavors.com\nEndeavors Technology, Inc. | cell: +1.714.928.5476 | http://endeavors.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Home Pages for Computer Scientists'}
