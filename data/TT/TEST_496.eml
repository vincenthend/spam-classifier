{'body': '\r\n Xserver has a well known issue with the i915 driver and it\'s DRI/DRM \r\n  limitation to 2048x2048 window size. So the default setup is not working \r\n  because in recent versions of X it loads drm by default creating \r\n  configuration that allows only  "clone" of the primary display with DRI \r\n  enabled on it.\r\n  The impact on kde is that it can not set dual display (only "clone" option \r\n  is available).\r\n  SOLVED: applying custom xorg.conf with \r\n        Option "NoAccel" "true"\r\n  in the device section and Position Option into each monitors config.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
