With such flagrant showings of opposition there would be more\ncoverage of the opposing ideas and thus the spreading of the dissenting\nmeme. A viri need not comply with the wishes of the attacked host, rather\nthe host had better make some antibodies or learn to adapt.\n\nPoint the second. Historicaly the "in yer face" mode of confrontation has\nbeen used to gain popular support and to grow from seeds "grass roots"\nmovements. Witness the big bold "in yer face" signature of Hancock on the\n"in yer  face" Declaration of the american colonies to the governing\npowers of england. Witness also the chicago seven, Others will follow in\nexamplare  form upon digging.\n\nNow point the third, is it annoying? Yes, and if your annoyed then the "in\nyer facers" have done thier job. Sad to say the polite persnikiters are\nteh very fule the "in yer facers" hope to ignite. If your burning, your\nbeing used.\n\nPointed the personal...The politics of the polite are more often the\nrefuge of backstabings,  closed mouth recourlessness and hypocritcal\nbehavoirs. Id rather hear what those who oppose me have to say than\nquietly be knifed by the slow hand of the coward.\n\n\n\nSeek not the polite or impolite but rather the reasons why.\n\n\n-tom\n\n\n\n', 'subject': "RE: Hanson's Sept 11 message in the National Review"}
