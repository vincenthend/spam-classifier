The van, which will be stopping at schools,\nlibraries and senior centers along the way, is equipped to provide free\nhigh-speed access to thousands of literary and artistic works that are\nalready in the public domain.\n\n--------\n\nI had the opportunity to visit the Internet Archive about a month ago, and\nsaw the bookmobile under construction. It\'s a neat idea. Take an SUV, put a\nsmall satellite dish on the top, and put a computer, printer, and binding\nmachine in the back. Voila -- people can search for a book, then print out a\ncopy right there on the spot. Quite literally on-demand printing. Total\nfixed cost of the computer/printer/binding machine, if bought new (the IA\nhad the equipment donated) is under $10k.\n\nOne of the goals is to show libraries across the country that they could, if\nthey wished, add these "virtual holdings" (public domain materials) to their\nexisting library, at a fixed cost most libraries can afford. This should be\ncompelling to small libraries in remote areas.\n\n- Jim\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Internet Archive bookmobile'}
