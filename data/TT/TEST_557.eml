It looks like you haven\'t run the latest make-kpkg.\r\n\r\nI just did a rebuild of an existing built source tree. The make-kpkg\r\noutput contained 8839 lines of output just to describe unlinking things\r\nin the debian/... directory. That 8839 lines is about 980kB. There was\r\nlater objcopy output from the make-kpkg process amounting to 180kB. The\r\nrest of the output is 73kB. It\'s a significant difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe". Trouble?
