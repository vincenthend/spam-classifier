See sed(1).\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTzafrir Cohen         | tzafrir@jabber.org | VIM is\r\nhttp://tzafrir.org.il |                    | a Mutt\'s\r\ntzafrir@cohens.org.il |                    |  best\r\ntzafrir@debian.org    |                    | friend\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
