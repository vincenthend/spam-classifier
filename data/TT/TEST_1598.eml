What is subjectively unusable for you, is=20\r\nperfectly usable for others and the other way round. Debian is not your=20\r\npersonal distro, it strives to keep balance. And balance is towards 4.4 sid=\r\ne=20\r\nyou like it or not due to many factors. When Squeeze is released, KDE 4.5 m=\r\nay=20\r\nbe in .3 or later patch release upstream so the point about the latest and=\r\n=20\r\ngreatest here is completely out-of-place.\r\n\r\nNow if at particular time upstream software does not meet your personal nee=\r\nds,=20\r\nyou go and look for alternatives. You talk like kdepim 4.3 was flawless. Bu=\r\nt=20\r\nit wasn\'t! There is no place for "software does not do X, remove it from=20\r\nstable" discussions here.\r\n\r\n> >  Just find\r\n> >  another software/solution which does, develop it by yourself, pay\r\n> >  somebody to develop it for you or ask kindly and wait till somebody\r\n> >  else is motivated enough to do it.\r\n>=20\r\n> I will, but I see no reason not to air my grievances.\r\n\r\nInsisting that others do something (revert to kdepim 4.3) based solely on y=\r\nour=20\r\npersonal grievances does not help productive communication.\r\n\r\n> > YOU run a dozen of DB servers,\r\n>=20\r\n> I\'m not the only person that does.

I find myself in the odd position=\r\n=20\r\nthat I mostly share opinion with you about excessive "explosion" of DB serv=\r\ner=20\r\ninstances on the desktop but I still can\'t help myself to argue. You starte=\r\nd=20\r\nthis off on a wrong foot by demanding to accommodate to your needs.\r\n\r\n> > YOU say KDE 4.4 is inappropriate for stable.\r\n>=20\r\n> That is my opinion.\r\n>=20\r\n> > Nothing objective and\r\n> >=20\r\n> >  YOU assume that your truth is an ultimate one.\r\n>=20\r\n> Not really.  I made objective statement about KMail based on observable\r\n> facts. I also voiced an opinion that I based on that statement.\r\n\r\nWhat facts? That kdepim/kmail needs akonadi? That\'s hardly news. Akonadi=20\r\nintegration is not stable enough? There is still time to improve it. That\'s=\r\n=20\r\nwhat Ana\'s blog was about.\r\n\r\n> >  If YOU have so\r\n> >  many problems with particular piece of software, look for better optio=\r\nns\r\n> >  or read the first part of this mail again.\r\n>=20\r\n> I have problems with a very narrow selection of selection of the software.\r\n> Specifically, I don\'t want to need MySQL installed in order to use KMail\r\n> effectively in Debian stable.\r\n\r\nIt is not like every mail client on the market suddenly needs MySQL. Actual=\r\nly,=20\r\nkmail is probably unique in this area.\r\n\r\n> There are a number of solutions to this.  Newer Akonadi should run on non-\r\n> MySQL data stores.  Older KMail doesn\'t talk to Akonadi.  Patches could be\r\n> applied to either.  Stable could include software from multiple KDE\r\n> releases, as has been done before.\r\n\r\nWhat I tried to say to you all this time, if Akonadi renders Kmail unusable=\r\n to=20\r\nyou, switch the client! Akonadi by itself is not a bug, it is not going awa=\r\ny!=20\r\nTake it or switch to something else, simple as that.\r\n\r\n=2D-=20\r\nModestas Vainius <modestas@vainius.eu>\r\n', 'subject': 'Re: KDE 4.4.3 in unstable'}
