{'body': 'Didn\'t we just have a discussion on FoRK how hard\nit is nowadays to write something that\'s not\nbuffer overflow protected? \n\nhttp://news.zdnet.co.uk/story/0,,t269-s2121250,00.html\n\n\n\nLocation: http://news.zdnet.co.uk/story/0,,t269-s2121250,00.html \n\nIM client vulnerable to attack \nIM client vulnerable to attack \n\nJames Pearce, ZDNet Australia  \n\nUsers of messenger client Trillian are vulnerable to attack, according to\ninformation security analyst John Hennessy.\n\nHennessy has published a proof-of-concept showing the latest version of\nTrillian, v0.73, is vulnerable to a buffer-overflow attack that will\nallow individuals with malicious intent to run any program on the\ncomputer.\n\nTrillion is a piece of software that allows you to connect to ICQ, AOL\nInstant Messenger, MSN Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger and IRC with a single\ninterface, despite some companies actively avoiding messenger\ninteroperability.\n\nAccording to Jason Ross, senior analyst at amr interactive, in June 2002\nthere were 28,000 home users of Trillian in Australia, about 0.4 percent\nof the Internet population, and 55,000 people using it at work, about 1.8\npercent of the Internet population.\n\nDavid Banes, regional manager of Symantec security response, told ZDNet\nAustralia the code appeared to be valid.\n\n"With these sort of things you have to find some process that would\naccept a connection, then throw loads of random data at it and get it to\ncrash," he said. "Once it\'s crashed, you can try to find a way to exploit\nit."\n\nHe said the proof-of-concept that was published is designed to run on\nNotepad, but could be easily modified to run any program on the system.\nHe said the problem was easy to fix by "writing protective code around\nthat particular piece to more closely validate the data around that\npiece."\n\n"Because people are pushed for productivity you tend to leave out the\nchecks and balances you should put in, which is why we have all these\nbuffer overflows and exploits out there now," said Banes.\n\nCerulean Studios, creator of Trillian, was contacted for comment but had\nnot responded by the time of publication.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor all security-related news, including updates on the latest viruses,\nhacking exploits and patches, check out ZDNet UK\'s Security News Section.\n\nHave your say instantly, and see what others have said.
