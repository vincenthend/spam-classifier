(Such\nas mine). There\'s no dependancies on libstdc++ other than binary ones.\n\nCurrently on release dwd2, which I\'m using on my home rawhide box.\n(Obviously not production, since the old apt works fine on production\nboxes).\n\nNow... Does anyone know of a good way to delete "old" RPMS from a\ndirectory containing both "new" and "old" RPMS? Say I have\nblurb-0.1.0-1.i386.rpm, blurb-0.1.0-2.i386.rpm, and\nblurb-0.1.1-1.i386.rpm, and want to remove the blurb-0.1.0-* because of\nthe presence of blurb-0.1.1-1? Anyone have a convenient script?\n\nDave.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: advice on 7.3.92 to 7.3.93, and Apt compiling (oh joy)'}
