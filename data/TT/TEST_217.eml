Why I have not updated to the latest ones \r\n(195.x)? Because "if it works, don\'t touch it" and I don\'t needed to do \r\nfancy things in that computer and the old version was (and is still) \r\nworking without glitches.\r\n \r\n>>> I\'ll look into that wiki (again),\r\n>>>\r\n>>>\r\n> it is almost like the old days of potato and woody. had to fresh up my\r\n> old brain again.   so i installed nvidia-glx and the other required\r\n> packages. that \'s nowadays much easier than in the wiki thanks to apt if\r\n> you start with <sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx>\r\n\r\nYes, I have also encountered the "Debian-way" plain easy. I thought \r\ninstalling nvidia drivers was going to be a headache but truly was not :-)\r\n\r\n> after that i put the appropriate sections in my /etx/X11/xorg.conf.\r\n> nvidia instead of in tel and i made a module section with Load "glx" in\r\n> it.\r\n> \r\n> i restarted the X-server and now *everything is working like a charm*\r\n> \r\n> he camale\xc3\xb3n, i really owe you, man! you really helped me out.\r\n> \r\n> many regards,\r\n\r\nGlad you got it working! :-D\r\n\r\nYou\'re welcome.\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\n\r\n-- \r\nCamale\xc3\xb3n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
