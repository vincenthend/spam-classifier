I added a modify time check thinking that \nit would make an improvement since we were reading it a *lot* more times in \nthe new code because we're trying to use the sequences.\n\nOn the other hand, the sequences files are probably being read out of cache \nwhen that happens anyway.\n\nEven with a small file, I'd think that the time taken to do a \n[file mtime $filename] would be worth it.  My code is in proc MhReadSeqs.\n\nChris\n\n-- \nChris Garrigues                 http://www.DeepEddy.Com/~cwg/\nvirCIO                          http://www.virCIO.Com\n716 Congress, Suite 200\nAustin, TX  78701\t\t+1 512 374 0500\n\n  World War III:  The Wrong-Doers Vs. the Evil-Doers.\n\n\n\n", 'subject': 'Re: New Sequences Window'}
