I\'ve put it in each version dir respectively. This\r\nis an extra package.\r\n\r\nAlso why would you convert something from rpm to deb, when you can go to the\r\nvendor and download for free the real code?\r\n\r\nI\'ve downloaded and put all I need in /opt/oracle\r\n\r\nll /opt/oracle/\r\n\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb1\xd1\x89\xd0\xbe 20\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 root    root    4096  6 \xd1\x8f\xd0\xbd\xd1\x83 14,37 .\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root    root    4096 14 \xd0\xb4\xd0\xb5\xd0\xba  2,22 ..\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 emanoil emanoil 4096 22 \xd0\xbd\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb5 16,58 instantclient_10_2\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 emanoil emanoil 4096 14 \xd0\xb4\xd0\xb5\xd0\xba  0,35 instantclient_11_1\r\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root    root      18  6 \xd1\x8f\xd0\xbd\xd1\x83 14,37 lib -> instantclient_11_1\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 emanoil emanoil 4096 22 \xd0\xbd\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb5 16,54 network\r\n\r\nexport ORACLE_HOME="/opt/oracle/instantclient_11_1"\r\nexport TNS_ADMIN="/opt/oracle/network/admin"\r\nexport PATH=/opt/oracle/instantclient_11_1:$PATH\r\n\r\n./configure --prefix=/usr --with-instant-client \\\r\n        --with-oracle-includes=/opt/oracle/instantclient_11_1/sdk/include \\\r\n        --with-oracle-libraries=/opt/oracle/instantclient_11_1  \\\r\n        --with-oci-version=11G\r\n\r\nmake\r\nmake install\r\n\r\nthat\'s it.\r\n\r\nI have to admit that for me the biggest challenge was to download the\r\npackages I need from the Oracle site.\r\n\r\nI remember I\'ve tried to debianize once but it failed and I gave up, because\r\nI didn\'t have the time.\r\n\r\nregards\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
