{'body': 'This is happening due to insufficient write access to the\n"razor-agent.log" file. I was getting the same error, but\nonly as a non-root user.  As a quick workaround, you can do\n"chmod go+w razor-agent.log".\n\nIn Agent.pm, when then the Logger object is created, it\ndoesn\'t check whether the logfile is writable by the current\nuser.
