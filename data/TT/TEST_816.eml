I write little snippets \r\nevery now and again and edit system startup files etc.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly a challenge though. I guess if I can interface dyndns.org and \r\nsmsclient relatively simply with options you mention, I\'ll probably manage it.\r\n\r\nI might also put a check in there for other protocols like http, just in case \r\nping happens to be the last protocol standing when the machine or connection is \r\nabout to keel over!
