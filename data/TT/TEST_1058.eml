Ick.  I hate it.  But it does a few\nthings right.  Like making indices for each folder, and not just by\ndate, but also by sender, message size, subject.  So I can sort by any\ncolumn instantly.\n\nI believe this is possible, too, with an IMAP compliant reader,\nprovided the IMAP server makes such indices.\n\nI am facing the fact that exmh has been left behind in some industry\nstandards.  I use it for my personal mail.  My mail server runs unix,\nand I connect over ssh and tunnel my X traffic over ssh.  With a slow\nlink, this makes exmh very slow.  And mime handling is pretty bad\ncompared with modern mailers.  I am just scared to move.  I've been\nusing MH or nmh since 1985 and exmh since 1995.  17 years is a long\ntime!\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-users mailing list\nExmh-users@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users\n\n\n", 'subject': 'Re: Sorting'}
