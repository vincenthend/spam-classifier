{'body': 'I\'m taking all my razored mail today and calling any 1-800 numbers I can\nfind.  I say "Hi, I\'m calling everyone that spammed me today to raise their\ncost of doing business.  You have a great day!"  I\'m told I should do it\nfrom a pay phone, so it costs them 50 cents per call.  If more people did\nthis, we could tie up their phone lines and cost them so much money they\ncould never make spam work.\n\nAlso fun is the simple "Die Spammer Die!"\n\nFox\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nRazor-users mailing list\nRazor-users@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-users\n\n\n', 'subject': '[Razor-users] Fun Uses of Razored Mail'}
