As Nate put it a moment ago, just move \r\non.\r\n\r\n> Are _you_ interested in doing it ?\r\n\r\nBackporting KDE4 applications to a KDE3 working environment is beyond \r\nmy skills. I can\'t even get Squeeze KDM to use a different background \r\nas it is.\r\n\r\n> At that game, there are two types of players: those who rant and\r\n> contribute to fix the root of their rant (aka code) and those who\r\n> rant and do nothing.\r\n\r\nGoing back to obsequious pandering is looking very tempting. Yes, us \r\nmere users have nothing to contribute, since we don\'t write code.\r\n\r\n> We are all volunteers and among those volunteers, nobody is\r\n> interested in maintaining KDE 3.5 within Debian.
