The IW add-on "tor button" configuration \r\nlocated at\r\n\r\n<right mouse click> Preferences/ Proxy Settings\r\n\r\nlists 2 options:\r\n\r\n(a) Use the recommended proxy settings for my version of Firefox (and a \r\ncheckbox is marked next to the only sub-option "Use Polipo" by default) or\r\n(b) Use custom proxy settings\r\n\r\nHand on heart I could not say when this change took place as I haven\'t \r\nbeen using IW + tor + privoxy for a while, so this came as quite a \r\nsurprise.  There was a recent update to tor though, IIRC, so it may well \r\nhave been during that.\r\n\r\nAG\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
