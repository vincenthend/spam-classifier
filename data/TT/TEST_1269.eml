{'body': 'Thanks for this information.  I gave Alsa a try, couldn\'t figure out how\nto enable digital out, although I\'m sure if I put enough time into it,\ncould have gotten it working.  Also when playing mp3s in analog mode,\nevery time I switched between mp3s there was a bit of static.  Noticed a\nnew distribution geared towards audio applications, AGNULA\n(http://www.agnula.org/) uses Alsa as well.  Seems though the latest\nopen source emu10k1 drivers (SBLive! 5.1) work fair enough.  Anyone else\nexperience these problems with Alsa?  Are there alot of people on this\nlist using Alsa?\n\nRegards,\n\nLance\n\nOn Sat, 2002-08-24 at 17:45, Angles Puglisi wrote:\n> FYI, This is how I make my ALSA rpms ... some people on the (null) list did not\n> realize it was pretty easy.\n> \n> btw, I do this lot since I\'ve upgraded from RH7.3 to Limbo1 to Limbo2 to Null all in\n> a week (probably).\n> \n> forward - original mail:\n>   From "Angles Puglisi" <angles@aminvestments.com>\n>   Date 08/24/2002 - 06:38:03 pm\n>   Subject Re: When are we going to get....\n> ----\n> \n\n> From:  Angles  Puglisi <angles@aminvestments.com>\n> To: limbo-list@example.com\n> Subject: Re: When are we going to get....\n> Date: 24 Aug 2002 22:40:40 +0000\n> \n> OK, I do this every time I update a kernel.\n> \n> The 1st time I added ALSA, I tried a non-root rpom build but the DEV things were not\n> made.
