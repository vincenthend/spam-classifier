However they include other fixes (including\r\nsome fixes that were never accepted by Junghanns due to bad\r\ncommunication).\r\n\r\nThere are some other changes apart from the bristuff fixes and we can\'t\r\nsimply call it "bristuffed".\r\n\r\n> \r\n> After telling them Debian/Lenny IS bristuffed they said this\r\n> "installation method" is not supported.
