Does that happen often, or only that once?\r\n\r\nFor now it has happened twice ... it could be that I have\r\ninstalled/configured something after logging in the first time. \r\n\r\nWhat is happening permanently is that if I click the logout button the whole\r\ndesktop freezes. I have to press CTRL+ALT+F[1-6] to restart kdm\r\n\r\nWhat I am missing now is also the old behavior from CTRL+ALT+DEL to get\r\nprompt for reboot or shutdown - or whatever. Now this combination is\r\nlocking the screen. Was it adopted from newer windows?\r\n\r\n>>\r\n> \r\n> Thanks. It will stay unusable for you until you tell us what you need\r\n> to use it! That\'s what I\'m here for.\r\n> \r\n\r\nWell, \r\n- kplayer was not working for DVB input.\r\n- korganizer does not start\r\n- kweather and kmoon are not visible (can not choose to activate), though it\r\nstates it\'s installed.\r\n\r\n- ALL kde apps like kplayer/organizer and probably others start very slowly\r\nabout 20-30secs to pop up\r\n\r\n\r\nI\'m sorry but I can not test anything that fast. it will take few weeks.\r\n\r\nI will probably test upgrading (As I said) from lenny to squeeze to sid. To\r\nsimulate an upgrade of my current system. I think this is more important.\r\nThis will take a while, so my plan for now is to see what basically works\r\nand what not.\r\n\r\nregards\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
