{'body': 'Use the GUI and don\'t delete files, use the other option, whats it called\nagain, the dustbin or something ;-)\n\nConor who only knows about symbolic links ;-))\n\nI\'m pretty sure that I have a softlink from\n/mnt/public/mnt/public/downloads/Linux/wasteCPU/setiathome to\n/home/cwynne/seti\n\nThe /mnt/pub....../seti.. directory resides on an external raidvolume and\n/home/../seti is on the internal IDE2 drive. \nSo I dont have to cd around the gaf. I suppose that would count as across\ndifferent devices. \n\nIf you\'re wondering [probably not] why /mnt/public is there twice, its\nbecause I restored from tapebackup and I didn\'t know that it keeps the\ndirectory structure. I know now ;-)\n\nActually, how can I fix that quickly and easily? I thought about firstly\nmv\'ing the structure to /tmp. Then copying it back again but I\'m sure some\nwee genius knows a quickie solution. Mind you I never even bothered trying a\nits not a priority now that its all linked anyway. \n\nCW\n\n--------------------------------\n hum.  interesting variation on the classic technique of\n redefining `rm\' to `mv\' the files into `./.trash/\' (or\n with a prefix of `#\' or a suffix of `~\'; the variations\n are endless).  these classic techniques only provide a\n means to roll back accidental `rm\'s, so there is still\n considerable scope for data lost as there are other ways\n of deleting files --- which is not a problem for this\n hard link idea.\n\n but, like the classic techniques, there is no rolling\n back of accidental overwrites.\n\n ( rolling back overwrites reminds me of the "snapshot"\n  facility on NetWork Appliance fileservers.  and of the\n  various "versioning" filesystems which appeared --- and\n  then vanished? --- over the years.... )\n\n one severe(?) gotcha is some files shouldn\'t have any\n hard links.  both RCS *,v (and hence CVS) and SCCS s.*\n files are like this --- the RCS(/CVS?)/SCCS toolsets\n complain if there are hard links.\n\ncheers,\n\t-blf-\n--\n Innovative, very experienced, Unix and      | Brian Foster    Dublin,\nIreland\n Chorus (embedded RTOS) kernel internals     | e-mail: blf@utvinternet.ie\n expert looking for a new position ...       | mobile: (+353 or 0)86 854\n9268\n  For a r\xe9sum\xe9, contact me, or see my website  http://www.blf.utvinternet.ie\n\n    Stop E$$o (ExxonMobile):  \xabWhatever you do, don\'t buy Esso --- they\n     don\'t give a damn about global warming.\xbb    http://www.stopesso.com\n     Supported by Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, and numerous others...\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users\' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n', 'subject': 'RE: [ILUG] hard- vs. soft-links [was: How to copy some files ]'}
