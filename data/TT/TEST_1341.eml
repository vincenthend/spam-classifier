{'body': 'Hi all\r\n\r\n=46rom time to time I have to assess Flash projects, and to assist my =\r\nmarking a few years ago I wrote a program which uses a Scanner to open =\r\nthe .fla file and read it on a "line by line" basis.  Although this is =\r\nreally stretching what a Scanner should do, it has proven surprisingly =\r\nuseful over the years.\r\n\r\nMy original version of the software was written with an "old" Xcode =\r\nstyle project using the now deprecated jam.  Recently I decided I needed =\r\nto make some changes to it and I thought it would be a good move to =\r\ntransfer it to Netbeans --- and it didn\'t work!  The Scanner wouldn\'t =\r\nread a .fla file when run from Netbeans, but it would when run from =\r\nXcode, using either a jam or ant type project.  It would also work if I =\r\nnavigated to the Netbeans "dist" folder and double clicked the jar =\r\ndirectly. =20\r\n\r\nThe following code shows the problem:\r\n\r\n      String fullFileName =3D "/Users/boblang1/Desktop/xxx.fla";\r\n     =20\r\n      try {\r\n        Scanner in =3D new Scanner (new File (fullFileName));\r\n        while (in.hasNextLine ()) {\r\n          String line =3D in.nextLine ();\r\n          System.out.println (line);\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      catch (Exception e) {\r\n        System.out.println ("Exception reading file: " + fullFileName);\r\n        System.out.println (e);\r\n      }\r\n\r\nWhen run inside Xcode or by double clicking the jar, the Scanner reads =\r\nthe .fla file.  When run inside Netbeans, it appears to open the file =\r\nbut won\'t return any lines (the while loop terminates early).  There are =\r\nno exceptions reported. =20\r\n\r\nBTW, the problem only seems to happen with .fla files.  I can read .txt =\r\nfiles quite successfully.\r\n\r\nI\'m running fully up to date Snow Leopard, with the latest developer =\r\npreview Java. As far as I can tell, I don\'t have any older versions of =\r\nJava on my computer.  All the versions in /System/Library appear to link =\r\nto Java 1.6.=20\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nBob\r\n\r\n\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
