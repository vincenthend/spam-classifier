I was faced with a situation that I did\r\nnot understand and thought that I would query those with far more\r\nexperience after searching the web yielded nothing useful. Would you\r\nsuggest that it is preferable for me to go to this guy\'s place not\r\nknowing a thing about what I\'m getting into, especially when the goal\r\n"read from / write to the card reader" is so straightforward?.\r\n\r\n\r\n>>> This is the important quote, I think: "Infinity USB Smart is based on t=\r\nhe\r\n>>> HID standard, no custom drivers are needed".\r\n>>>\r\n>>\r\n>> HID is for keyboards and mice, not card readers.
