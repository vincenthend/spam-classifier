So my misuse of the term "migrate" is me actually doing a copy of the\r\nworking system to a new, larger device and then zap the original.\r\n\r\nI\'d hoped there was a block by block way to do it so I didn\'t have to set\r\nup the partitions & filesystems ahead of time but I suppose that part won\'t\r\nbe too painful.\r\n\r\nThe system is relatively idle during these types of surgeries because I\r\nboot from a live CD so the data on disk isn\'t churning.\r\n\r\nThanks to all who responded, it gave me a lot to consider for this type of\r\nproject. Like doing proper diffs afterwards to make sure everything landed\r\non the new device properly!\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
