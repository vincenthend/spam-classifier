At least that\'s the report\nI heard on the Razor list in the past...\n\nTheo, does it work now that you /dev/null\'d the logfile?\n\n> >    - version number (says "cvs")\n> >    - tag tree as "Rel" this time too\n\nI won\'t bother tagging with Rel, IMO; I don\'t think we should\nrely on the version control system inside our code, so I\'ve just\nput a line in Mail/SpamAssassin.pm instead.   I will of course\ntag with a release *label* though.\n\n--j.\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: [SAdev] 2.41 release? '}
