I went looking for technical docs on what you do to mangle web \n    pages. None. I went looking for a desktop emulator that I could run to \n    simulate your device on my computer. None. I went looking to see an \n    acknowledgement of the shortcomings of your device, indicating that the \n    situation would be improved. None.  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Joe[3]!_)\n\n[1] http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?archives/003378.php\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/gQqkijtv3NhWZ\n[3] http://joeclark.org/access/\n\n\n", 'subject': "Sidekick's browser blows"}
