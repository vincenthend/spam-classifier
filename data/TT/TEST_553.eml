Your post has been invaluable in fixing some faulty thinking\r\non my part, and in provoking other useful posts. But I want more ...\r\n\r\nThe errors that I am experiencing are all similar. The first\r\nindication of a problem is a message from the kernel (I think). An\r\nexample is:\r\n\r\nkernel: [78454.939948] journal commit I/O error\r\n\r\nThis appears on all xterm windows on the affected machine. On the\r\nxterm that is controlling a process that is using one of the USB\r\ndrives, there follows a long sequence of error messages about the\r\ndrive being read-only, which stops after a while. Or sometimes I stop\r\nit by typing ^C on that xterm. \r\n\r\nWhen this happens, all the USB drives (3 of them) disappear from\r\n/dev/disks/by-label (they are all labeled by me). I have not\r\ndiscovered any to make them re-appear, short of rebooting the\r\ncomputer. After reboot, I run e2fsck on all of them, and always get a\r\nlongish delay on each while e2fsck commits (or whatever) the\r\njournal. This can take a few seconds or up to half a minute. Then\r\nI manually mount them using pmount, and all data upto the point\r\nwhere the crash happened seems to be present. \r\n\r\nI have installed smartmontools, but I think there is some\r\nincompatibility between the installed version and the installed\r\ndocs. The README.Debian makes reference to editing some lines in the\r\nconfig file that are not present in the default, package installed,\r\nconfig file. There is (apparently) some incompatibility between using\r\nthe daemon and using smartctl. The problem host is running Lenny, but\r\nthe docs seem to be the same as on a different host that is running\r\nSqueeze. \r\n\r\nI would very much appreciate some help in understanding the docs.\r\nWhat is a safe thing for a nubie to type as a first command to\r\nsmartctl? \r\n\r\n-- \r\nPaul E Condon           \r\npecondon@mesanetworks.net\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
