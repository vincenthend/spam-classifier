But, as you\'ve seen, using the "raw"=20\r\ndevice name doesn\'t really help either.  Different kernel versions, and eve=\r\nn=20\r\nkernels compiled with different options, will use different "raw" names for=\r\n=20\r\nthe devices.  In odd setups, the device name might change from boot to boot=\r\n as=20\r\ndevices are (now) discovered asynchronously so they may be assigned names i=\r\nn a=20\r\ndifferent order based how quickly they respond to the kernel.\r\n=2D-=20\r\nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr.           \t ,=3D ,-_-. =3D.\r\nbss@iguanasuicide.net            \t((_/)o o(\\_))\r\nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy \t `-\'(. .)`-\'\r\nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/        \t     \\_/\r\n', 'subject': 'Re: device names'}
