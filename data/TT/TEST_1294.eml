I\r\neven set a LID_LIBRARY_PATH variable in case it was not a typo.  It\r\nstill doesn\'t work.  Setting the command line debugging variable, I\r\nfound that it cannot find the PPD file.  Does it only work if the CUPS\r\nserver is running locally? In our case, we use a central CUPS server\r\nrunning on a non-standard port.  This is reflected\r\nin /etc/cups/client.conf.  How do we tell acroread where the printer\r\nserver and PPD files are?
