{'body': "Hi,\n\n\tI'm no longer able to play encrypted dvd's using the xine rpm from freshrpms. \nI think it was about a week ago when I last rented some dvd's, worked just \nfine, but apparently since the latest xine update on freshrpms, it won't \nanymore. \nThe output is :\n\ninput_dvd: Sorry, this plugin doesn't play encrypted DVDs. The legal status\n           of CSS decryption is unclear and we can't provide such code.\n           Please check http://dvd.sf.net for more information.\n\nI'm pretty sure it worked with the previous freshrpms release... Any way of \nrolling back updates ?\n\nNick Verhaegen\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n", 'subject': 'xine problems'}
