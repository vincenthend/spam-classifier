{'body': 'Xander Blakley quotes a Russian joke in his terrific book _Siberia Bound_. \nFrenchman, American, and Russian get to talking bout which country has the \nmore desireable women. Frenchman says, "Ah, when a Frenchman puts his hands \naround zee waist of his lover, his fingers form a complete circle and \ntouch--not because his hands are so large, but because zee  French woman\'s \nwaist is so slender."\n    American says "Yep, but when an American woman gets on a horse, her heels \nreach all the way down to the ground--and it\'s not because American horses \nare short, but because American women have such endlessly long, sexy legs."\n    Russian says: "Da, but when a Russian slaps his wife\'s ass on his way out \nof the house in the morning, it\'s still jiggling when he comes back after \nwork--and it\'s not because her ass is so big, but because the Russian work \nday is so short."\n\nTom\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: "Ouch.
