{'body': 'In 1957, a monastery in Thailand was being relocated and a group of monks\nwas put in charge of moving a giant clay Buddha. In the midst of the move\none of the monks noticed a crack in the Buddha. Concerned about damaging the\nidol, the monks decided to wait for a day before continuing with their task.\nWhen night came, one of the monks came to check on the giant statue. He\nshined his flashlight over the entire Buddha. When he reached the crack he\nsaw something reflected back at him. The monk, his curiosity aroused, got a\nhammer and a chisel and began chipping away at the clay Buddha. As he\nknocked off piece after piece of clay, the Buddha got brighter and brighter.\nAfter hours of work, the monk looked up in amazement to see standing before\nhim a huge solid-gold Buddha.\n\nMany historians believe the Buddha had been covered with clay by Thai monks\nseveral hundred years earlier before an attack by the Burmese army. They\ncovered the Buddha to keep it from being stolen. In the attack all the monks\nwere killed, so it wasn\'t until 1957, when the monks were moving the giant\nstatue, that the great treasure was discovered. Like the Buddha, our outer\nshell protects us from the word: our real treasure is hidden within. We\nhuman beings unconsciously hide our inner gold under a layer of clay. All we\nneed to do to uncover our gold is to have the courage to chip away at our\nouter shell, piece by piece.\n\nCould you be sitting on your own gold mine?
