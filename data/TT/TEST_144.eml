I also have an Intel embedded \r\ncard but IIRC, I disabled it in the BIOS as soon as I plugged the nvidia \r\ncard (7600 GS).\r\n\r\nOTOH, it seems that device ID corresponds to nvida 9400 GT. So I would \r\ntest with the nvidia Debian drivers. If they do not work, you can always \r\ncome back and activate the Intel one.\r\n\r\n> I\'ll look into that wiki (again),\r\n> \r\n> it can take some time before i answer again: got to take care of my\r\n> family now,\r\n\r\nTake your time.
