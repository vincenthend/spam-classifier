This is what I would expect based\r\non your -startBlueToothThread: method, as it doesn't appear to create\r\na source or timer. If you wanted to keep the thread alive, I would\r\nattach a dummy timer to the run loop that fires after some\r\nextraordinary amount of time. (Assuming you're not using the Bluetooth\r\nAPIs on the thread...)\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
