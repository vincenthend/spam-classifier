On the IBM ThinkPad machines that I use (a 600\r\nand a 390E) it is Fn+F7.  Consult your hardware documentation.\r\n\r\nSwitching between the two is much easier if your external monitor\r\nis an LCD monitor.  The internal display probably runs at 60 Hz vertical\r\nrefresh.  The external monitor, if it is an LCD display, will probably\r\nwant to run at 60 Hz vertical refresh also.  An external CRT monitor,\r\nhowever, will probably have noticeable flicker at 60 Hz vertical refresh.\r\nIt will want to use a higher vertical refresh rate: at least 72 Hz.\r\n\r\nSwitching back and forth dynamically between internal and external monitors\r\nis tricky if they want to use different resolutions and refresh rates.\r\nIt often won\'t work.\r\n\r\n-- \r\n  .\'\'`.
