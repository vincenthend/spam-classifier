I\'ll try and remember to fix this\r\n (feel free to file a bug report to remind me). \r\n\r\n        I am not sure why the revision flag was not taking effect (I\r\n have not had time to look into the mails yet), but the +drm3 is coming\r\n from the kernel code (something is setting .localversions or the ilk).\r\n\r\n        manoj\r\n-- \r\nGuard against physical unruliness.
