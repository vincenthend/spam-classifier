Don't trust them!\n\n\n\n------- You are receiving this mail because: -------\nYou are the assignee for the bug, or are watching the assignee.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nSpamassassin-devel mailing list\nSpamassassin-devel@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-devel\n\n\n", 'subject': '[SAdev] [Bug 1052] New: bondedsender.com is a scam'}
