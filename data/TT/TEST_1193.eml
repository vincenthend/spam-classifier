Macintosh is but one product Apple offers.\r\n\r\nThis is so true.\r\nWhen I looked at establishing AppleUsers.org, as a central location of  \r\nresources for Australian User Groups, I thought long and hard about  \r\nthe name I was going to call the group... and I deliberately steered  \r\nclear of using Mac or Macintosh in the name... as I was aware that  \r\nApple provides more than that product.\r\n\r\nAlso Apple themselves have never referred to User Groups as Macintosh  \r\nUser Groups... the official logo they provide actually says Apple User  \r\nGroup\r\n\r\nMind you MUG sounds better as an acronym then AUG does :)\r\n\r\n> A for profit enterprise has a clear goal.

World hunger, the\r\n> environment, and animal welfare are causes.\r\n\r\nApple has saved itself... and as much as I believe User Groups did a  \r\nfar better job of keeping the Apple Flag visible back in the \'90\'s  \r\nthen Apple itself did, that is no longer the case in the 21st Century\r\n\r\n> A User Group is neither a for profit enterprise or a cause.

Putting into perspective reduces the emotion and the\r\n> attachment to the ways of the past.\r\n\r\nAs others have mentioned, could you have chosen a better analogy than  \r\nHannah Montana :)\r\nbut the point you are making is quite correct.\r\n\r\nI have friends who are involved with Local Historical Societies, Model  \r\nTrain (and even real ones) Appreciation Societies, and even reptile  \r\nkeepers who get together to discuss raising of snakes, lizards etc...  \r\nthey don\'t expect that one single company owes them anything to help  \r\nthem exist or to function.  Apple User Groups should look at how some  \r\nother \'social\', \'hobby\' and \'fan\' clubs work.\r\n\r\n> Nobody wants to hear they need to adapt and many are afraid.

We\'ve done it this way and it works."\r\n> Even better  "Our members want it this way."\r\n\r\nEvery group that I have seen take that attitude isn\'t around anymore,  \r\nor are quite visibly killing themselves right now\r\n\r\n> Problem of course is, when you do what the members want, then you\r\n> aren\'t leading.

You\'ll be paralyzed by the\r\n> status quo\r\n\r\nWhilst I strongly advise all User Groups that they need to EVOLVE,  \r\nthey don\'t need to be reactionary with changes. Evolution is a gradual  \r\nchange.\r\n\r\nAnd whilst every group needs new members to survive, let alone expand,  \r\nwe have to remember that Marketing 101 theorem that it is often easier  \r\nto retain an existing customer then it is to get a new one.\r\n\r\nSo don\'t suddenly alienate your existing membership, but rather help  \r\nlead them\r\n\r\n> I\'m not surprised by Apple\'s success.

The Board itself effectively nominates itself  \r\nand then shareholders ratify those nominations.... usually for the  \r\nBoard as a block and not for individual nominees.\r\n\r\nAnd shareholders certainly don\'t get a say in the day to day  \r\nmanagement of the company nor the projects that Apple work on and  \r\neventually bring to market or even kill off before they get to market!\r\n\r\n> I hope this leads to an interesting and much needed discussion that is\r\n> long overdue.\r\n\r\nhear, hear :)\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nNicholas Pyers (nicholas@appleusers.org)\r\nFounder & Publisher, AppleUsers.org\r\n\r\nhttp://www.appleusers.org/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
