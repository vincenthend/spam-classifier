The combined solution enables IT managers and users to simply extend security and\nencryption to every\nMagi-enabled device for the direct device-to-device sharing and interaction of corporate data and workflow\nbetween workgroups within and\nbeyond the enterprise.\n\nSecure collaboration between desktops and corporate systems calls for enterprises to build complex and costly\nnetwork infrastructures. This\ncombination of technologies from the two companies eliminates both overheads, and also the need for specific\nsecurity tools for each desktop\napplication such as Microsoft Project. With Magi\'s secure RSA Security-based peer environment, collaboration\ncan now be rapidly, easily and\nsecurely extended across all devices and company firewalls, and workgroups can interact with colleagues,\npartners and clients without concern\nin compromising corporate information. This brings true Internet scaling to corporations needing to interact\nhighly securely with strong\nencryption and authentication across firewalls.\n\n"In these challenging times, there can be no compromise in safeguarding corporate data and knowledge," says\nBernard Hulme, chairman and\nCEO of Endeavors Technology. "Embedding RSA Security encryption software into Magi products provides IT\nmanagers with added\nassurance, speed and cost savings, and a proven security net to accelerate the deployment of business-centric\npeer-to-peer computing"\n\nEndeavors Technology joins the RSA Secured\xae Partner Program. The program is designed to ensure complete\ninteroperability between\npartner products and RSA Security\'s solutions including RSA SecurID\xae two-factor authentication, RSA\nClearTrust\xae Web access\nmanagement, RSA BSAFE\xae encryption and RSA Keon\xae digital certificate management.\n\nThe strategic partnership paves the way for Magi Enterprise to bear the RSA Secured brand on product packaging\nand advertising, be listed in\nRSA Secured Partner Solutions directories, and have RSA Security\'s out-of-the-box, certified interoperability.\nIt will also lead to joint\nmarketing and promotional activities between the two firms, mutual field sales engagement opportunities on\njoint accounts, and 24x7 worldwide\nbusiness continuity support.\n\n"Endeavors Technology is taking a leadership role by providing the highest-level of security in its enterprise\nproducts and streamlining the\ndeployment process for IT managers," says Stuart Cohen, director of partner development at RSA Security. "By\ncombining our products,\nenterprise customers have a solution that provides encryption and authentication across firewalls."\n\nAbout Magi\nMagi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms today\'s Web into a highly secure\ninter- and intra-enterprise\ncollaboration network.
