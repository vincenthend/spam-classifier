Indeed, the problem is\nusually _preventing_ this from happening, as Microsoft Corporation\'s\ninstallers seem to forever be overwriting your MBRs when you least wish\nit, without asking your permission.\n\n-- \nCheers,               "We\'re sorry; you have reached an imaginary number.\nRick Moen             Please rotate your \'phone ninety degrees and try again."\nrick@linuxmafia.com\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users\' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: [ILUG] removing lilo'}
