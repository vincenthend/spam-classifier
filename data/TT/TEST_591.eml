{'body': 'I\'m not sure if this is really a razor problem/issue or a sendmail\nproblem. Here\'s the scenario... My mail server is a 150mhz PC funning\nFreeBSD 4.4. Ordinarily, the machine is quite idle; it supports my\nwife\'s web site with Apache server running on it and a few other\nservices (jabber, etc). Between the various members of our family, we\nget a fair amount of email coming in (mailing lists, etc). On\noccasion, our DSL-based ISP dies for a number of hours. When we get a\nreconnection to the Internet, I get a huge flow of emails coming in\nwhich are then filtered via razor. As a result, I will sometimes see\nover 20+ sendmail processes running at the same time after such an\noccasion. The machine is then REALLY slow.\n\nI noticed that my /etc/procmailrc file had had no arguments associated\nwith the call to razor-check. There was something in the log, though,\nto make me suspicious that it was possibly not seeing all my razor\nfiles. So I have just added "-home /etc/razor" as an argument. I\nhaven\'t had any down time since then so I cannot comment on whether\nthis change has sped up my razor processing a noticable amount. (This\nparagraph may be an aside to my real problem, the first paragraph\nabove; but I thought I should be complete in my description.)\n\nAt any rate, has anyone else suffered from a backlog of email\nprocessing creating lots and lots of sendmail processes?  Is there,\nperhaps, a way to limit the number of sendmail processes?\n\nAny ideas would be welcome.\n\nThanks,\nJoe\n---\nJoe Berry\njoe@topshot.com\nAIM "joe topshot"\nYahoo Msgr "joetopshot"\njabber "joetopshot@topshot.com"\nBaltimore, MD\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old\ncell phone?
