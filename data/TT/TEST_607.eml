Interesting that a different wish comes up\nfast, there might be a borkedness in 8.4.\n\n> Using the latest CVS, when I open exmh and the folder I\'m in has unseen\n> messages and I hit next, exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages\n> rather than to the first unseen in the current folder.\n\nHmm.. weirdness..\n\n> Finally, when I reach the end of the messages in a folder and go on to\n> the next unseen, exmh always goes back to inbox (which has no unseen\n> messages) rather than the next folder with unseen messages.
