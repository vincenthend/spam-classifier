{'body': "URL: http://boingboing.net/#85534163\nDate: Not supplied\n\nNTT DoCoMo have released a paper on the use of human flesh as a networking \nmedium: \n\n    A device attached to a PDA can send and receive weak electrical signals \n    through people, with human bodies as communications circuits, the paper \n    said, citing sources close to the companies. \n\n    Apparel and handbags have their own conductivity, allowing an electrical \n    connection to a PDA that can remain in one's pocket, the paper said. \n\n    In this way, people can exchange e-mail addresses, names and phone numbers \n    while shaking hands, with the data automatically written into both their \n    PDAs, the paper said.  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Alan!_)\n\n[1] http://www.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4057,5239758%255E13762,00.html\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/tFBrRGn3CvLk9\n\n\n", 'subject': '10Mb/s through skin'}
