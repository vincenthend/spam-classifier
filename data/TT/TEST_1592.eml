This piece has been up on the wall of our\nCTO\'s office for years. It deserves to be forked, or even reforked.\n\n- Joe\n\n(BTW, RAID is the home-grown bug tracking system used at Microsoft.\nSee e.g. http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/CrossTalk/1995/oct/Shippin.asp.\nIt was a fine tool, better than any other I\'ve had to use...)\n\n\n\nThe Bug Count Also Rises\n\n\nby John Browne\n(Imitation Hemingway Contest Winner)\n\nIn the fall of that year the rains fell as usual and washed the leaves \nof the dust and dripped from the leaves onto the ground. The shuttles \ndrove through the rainy streets and took the people to meetings, then \nlater brought them back, their tires spraying the mist into the air.\n\nMany days he stood for a long time and watched the rain and the shuttles \nand drank his double-tall mochas. With the mochas he was strong.\n\nHernando who worked down the hall and who was large with microbrews came \nto him and told him that the ship day was upon them but the bugs were \nnot yet out. The bugs which were always there even when you were in \nCafes late at night sipping a Redhook or a double-tall mocha and you \nthought you were safe but they were there and although Enrico kept the \nfloor swept clean and the mochas were hot the bugs were there and they \nate at you.\n\nWhen Hernando told him this he asked how many bugs. "The RAID is huge \nwith bugs," Hernando said. "The bugs are infinite."\n\n"Why do you ask me? You know I cannot do this thing anymore with the bugs."\n\n"Once you were great with the bugs," Hernando said. "No one was \ngreater," he said again. "Even Prado."\n\n"Prado? What of Prado? Let Prado fix the bugs."\n\nHernando shrugged. "Prado is finished. He was gored by three Sev 2\'s in \nChicago. All he does now is drink herb tea and play with his screensavers."\n\n"Herb tea?"\n\n"It is true, my friend." Hernando shrugged again. Later he went to his \noffice and sat in the dark for a long time. Then he sent e-mail to Michaels.\n\nMichaels came to him while he was sipping a mocha. They sat silently for \nawhile, then he asked Michaels, "I need you to triage for me."\n\nMichaels looked down. "I don\'t do that anymore," he said.\n\n"This is different. The bugs are enormous. There are an infinity of bugs."\n\n"I\'m finished with that," Michaels said again. "I just want to live \nquietly."\n\n"Have you heard Prado is finished? He was badly gored. Now he can only \ndrink herb tea."\n\n"Herb tea?" Michaels said.\n\n"It is true," he said sorrowfully.\n\nMichaels stood up. "Then I will do it, my friend," he said formally. "I \nwill do it for Prado, who was once great with the bugs. I will do it for \nthe time we filled Prado\'s office with bouncy balls, and for the time \nPrado wore his nerf weapons in the marketing hall and slew all of them \nwith no fear and only a great joy at the combat. I will do it for all \nthe pizza we ate and the bottles of Coke we drank."\n\nTogether they walked slowly back, knowing it would be good. As they \nwalked the rain dripped softly from the leaves, and the shuttles carried \nthe bodies back from the meetings.\n\n-- \nThe Combatant State is your father and your mother, your only\nprotector, the totality of your interests. No discipline can\nbe stern enough for the man who denies that by word or deed.\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: A message for our times'}
