The bombes used for Enigma were\nelectro-mechanical. I\'m not aware of any application of optical techniques\nto Enigma, unless they were done in the US and are still classified. And\nclearly, the first bulk breaks of Enigma were done by the bombes, so I\nguess it depends whether you count bombes as computers or not, whether this\nstatement has any credibility at all.\n\nGreg.\n\n\n\nWilliams/Zenon 2004 campaign page: http://www.ben4prez.org\n\nGreg Rose                                       INTERNET: ggr@qualcomm.com\nQualcomm Australia          VOICE:  +61-2-9817 4188   FAX: +61-2-9817 5199\nLevel 3, 230 Victoria Road,                http://people.qualcomm.com/ggr/\nGladesville NSW 2111    232B EC8F 44C6 C853 D68F  E107 E6BF CD2F 1081 A37C\n\n--- end forwarded text\n\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.
