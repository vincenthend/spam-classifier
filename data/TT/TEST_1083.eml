I figured it was better to find out if "all but\none" testing had any appreciable value.  It looks like it doesn\'t so\nI\'ll forget about it.\n\n> Another area for potentially fruitful study:  it\'s clear that the\n> highest-value indicators usually appear "early" in msgs, and for spam\n> there\'s an actual reason for that:  advertising has to strive to get your\n> attention early.

In pratice that would probably work fine.  \n\n> sometimes an on-topic message starts well but then rambles.\n\nNever.  I remember the time when I was ten years old and went down to\nthe fishing hole with my buddies.  This guy named Gordon had a really\nhuge head.  Wait, maybe that was Joe.  Well, no matter.  As I recall, it\nwas a hot day and everyone was tired...Human Growth Hormone...girl with\nhuge breasts...blah blah blah......\n\n', 'subject': '[Spambayes] all but one testing'}
