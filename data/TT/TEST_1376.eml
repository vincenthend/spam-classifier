{'body': "Hey all,\r\n\r\n\tI realize this has come up before, but I am still confused after  \r\nreading through the old emails. I have an app that uses Quicktime for  \r\nJava. I would like to, maybe not right away, but at some point, update  \r\nmy app to do the right thing. The right thing, apparently, is to use  \r\nQTKit, because it is the only 64-bit solution.\r\n\r\n\tThis seems crazy to me, though, because it is OS X specific, which  \r\nmeans I need another solution for windows. What is the 64-bit solution  \r\n(going to be) for windows? Does this mean every developer who wants to  \r\nwrite cross-platform QT code (not just Java) is supposed to write  \r\ntheir own portability layer for QuickTime? Is there an open source  \r\nsolution out there or in the works? Is there another solution that  \r\npeople are using other than QT?\r\n\r\nI need file conversion from a wide variety of file types (esp audio)  \r\nand video playback, although I will need some editing in the future.  \r\nJMF+JavaSound won't cut it. Not even close. I need way more file  \r\nformats than they support. You used to be able to use QTJ as a plugin  \r\nfor JMF to provide file reading/writing. Perhaps there is a way to do  \r\nthat with a minimal QT Java layer? Okay, now I'm just thinking out  \r\nloud. Sorry.\r\n\r\n\tAny thoughts, advice pointers are appreciated. I have not seen the  \r\ncross-platform issue addressed, and the only replacements for QTJ I've  \r\nseen are OS Specific (eg rococoa).\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\n\r\n\tbjorn\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\nBjorn Roche\r\nXO Wave\r\nDigital Audio Production and Post-Production Software\r\nhttp://www.xowave.com\r\nhttp://blog.bjornroche.com\r\nhttp://myspace.com/xowave\r\n\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
