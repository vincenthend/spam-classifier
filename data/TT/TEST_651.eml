There were two ways\r\nyou could get broken holds, and I fixed one in version 0.4.11:\r\n\r\n  * The aptitude dependency resolver will now refuse to adjust held\r\n    packages or install forbidden versions unless you manually allow\r\n    it to.  This behavior can be disabled by setting\r\n    Aptitude::ProblemResolver::Allow-Break-Holds to "false".\r\n\r\n    aptitude will still break holds when packages are being\r\n    automatically installed; there is a pending patch against apt that\r\n    eliminates this behavior.\r\n\r\n  and the other in 0.5.9rc1:\r\n\r\n  + [all] aptitude now uses the new hooks in apt to prevent the greedy\r\n          resolver from removing packages or breaking holds.\r\n\r\n          (Closes: #177374, #205049, #374353, #376802, #406506,\r\n                   #430816, #434731, #442420, #452589)\r\n\r\n  I am not, at present, aware of any other circumstances where aptitude\r\nwrongly breaks holds.  That said, I don\'t put packages on hold very\r\noften, so I depend on users to send bug reports if they\'re seeing that\r\nbehavior.\r\n\r\n  Daniel\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
