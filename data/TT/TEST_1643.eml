{'body': 'Uh, WWII Enigma was cracked at Bletchly Park, based on the work of some \nPoles, who had been trying to figure out when they would be invaded.   \nEntirely mechanical!   Definitely not optical at all.    Enigma was \noriginally broken based on bad use practice.  If it had been employed more \nsensibly it would have been a lot harder.\n\nSee "The Code Book" by Singh, Doubleday, 1999.     Or, for that matter, \n"Cryptonomicon" by Stephenson, which is a fictionalization of the Enigma \ncracking story, and pretty accurate.\n\nI eventually get born as a side-effect of the Battle of Britain, you \nsee....\n\nComputing with interference patterns, etc, makes perfect sense, but Enigma \nwas cracked by building mechanical systems that were essentially Enigma \nmachines and brute-forcing.\n\nEirikur\n\n\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: Optical analog computing?'}
