Your scheme would require closed specifications and closed\r\nsoftware to work. This list, however, is all about free software.\r\n\r\n- --\r\nJohannes\r\n\r\nIn questions of science, the authority of a thousand is not worth the\r\nhumble reasoning of a single individual.\r\n- - Galileo Galilei, physicist and astronomer (1564-1642)\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.9 (GNU/Linux)\r\n\r\niEUEARECAAYFAkvNS+oACgkQC1NzPRl9qEVM2wCfQpAVsTAx7GnbTUminwiqUIlp\r\ncm4AlRF4NIAhaaT6neYDcg0rYaXGs+k=\r\n=XYrP\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
