{'body': 'The die offs in areas with better records parallel and support the\nclaims that European diseases were devastating to all American\nhemisphere populations, and the reverse was never true.  Unlike, for\nexample, India or Asia.\n\nThere is a hot dispute about the original size of the indigenous\npopulation, but the evidence for a high density in the Mexican area is\nsound.  It was up here in the North or in the Amazon where I\'m a little\nmore suspicious of very high upward revisions.\n\nAt least that was my take.\n\nI have never heard anyone seriously argue that European diseases were\nnot a significant factor, or that there were not in fact a lot of Aztec\npeople prior to Cortez.  Gee, I\'ve never before heard someone argue\nunseriously about it either.\n\nDo you have a reference for a book or article which does so?\n\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of\nRobert\n> Harley\n> Sent: Sunday, August 18, 2002 4:57 PM\n> To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org\n> Cc: rah@shipwright.com\n> Subject: Re: Al\'Qaeda\'s fantasy ideology: Policy Review no. 114\n> \n> >See Jared Diamond\'s excellent "Guns, Germs, and Steel" for the story.\n> \n> Yeah, I know the party line.
