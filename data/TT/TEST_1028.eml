Have you tried both?\n- Is this using binariy packages or recompiling source ones?\n\nI remember a user having trouble with a particular DVD ever since upgrading\nlibdvdcss to a recent version, but haven't heard the end of the story.\n\nMatthias\n\n-- \nClean custom Red Hat Linux rpm packages : http://freshrpms.net/\nRed Hat Linux release 7.3 (Valhalla) running Linux kernel 2.4.18-10acpi\nLoad : 0.07 0.20 0.21\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n", 'subject': 'Re: xine cannot play DVDs - "liba52: a52_block error"'}
