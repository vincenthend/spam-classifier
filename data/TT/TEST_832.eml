In\nfact, it quite possibly never did the way it was intended to (I have just\nbeen browsing the 2.5 sources, and that seems to be attempting to do things\nthat I never saw happen).\n\nIt may be that your new sequence method just exposed the bug that had been\nthere all along.\n\nGiven this, I won't be sending any bug reports to the nmh people.  If nmh\never seems to be showing any signs further progress, and if I remember this\nthen, I might send them a change request.   The code to make the change is\ntrivial.\n\nkre\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers\n\n", 'subject': 'Re: New Sequences Window'}
