In fact, it was written in the days of Woody.\r\n(Woody -> Sarge -> Etch -> Lenny -> Squeeze)\r\nAnd parts of it are obsolete.  But the author focuses on the core stuff of\r\nUnix/Linux, and so most of it is still current.  It\'s an excellent guide\r\nfor how to accomplish common computing tasks in Linux, usually with a\r\ncommand line tool, and the author has a clear bent toward Debian.\r\n\r\n   http://dsl.org/cookbook/cookbook_toc.html\r\n\r\nThis is the original version of the book, and it is free.  There\'s an\r\nexpanded 2nd Edition available in hard copy for a fee.\r\n\r\n-- \r\n  .\'\'`.
