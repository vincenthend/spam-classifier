I\'ve always had the feeling that\r\nmost of the big filesystems cared a lot about scaling up in file-size,\r\nbut not too much about anything else.\r\n\r\nI\'m a Reiser3 user myself, and I\'ve never had any problems with it.\r\n\r\n(The trouble with it being "long in the tooth" is mostly hypothetical,\r\nisn\'t it?)\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
