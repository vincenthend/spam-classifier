Flash and Frames are the bane of the web. Can't properly =\r\nsearch, bookmark, print, copy&paste, etc. any of these. May they die a =\r\nquick, painful death, they caused enough suffering for users and web =\r\ndevelopers alike.\r\n\r\nHaving a several dozen web pages open sucks the life out of the fastest =\r\nmachines, because of all the flash. That I only could suspect until 10.6 =\r\nput plug-ins in subprocesses. The relative CPU load between all of =\r\nSafari vs. the Flash plug-in speaks volumes.\r\n\r\nAs much as I have to criticize about the closed nature/censorship of the =\r\nAppStore ecosystem, I'm THRILLED that Apple isn't bending. I hope Apple =\r\ncan give the blow of death to Flash, which has been more than an =\r\nannoyance for many years. I can't wait until that's a chapter in =\r\ncomputing HISTORY. Bravo Jobs&Co.!!!\r\n\r\nI also support his statement about Adobe being lazy. No version of any =\r\nMacromedia/Adobe Suite has ever run properly on any machine that has a =\r\ncase-sensitvive root file system. If software is properly written, it =\r\nshouldn't even notice a difference, and the only parties which have to =\r\nbe aware of the difference are users that copy files in a mixed file =\r\nsystem environment, or writers of backup/file-management software (where =\r\n2 files on one file system might map to one file on another).\r\n\r\nOnly sloppy coding where paths are not #define-ed in one place but more =\r\nor less accurately copy&paste-ed all over the code base causes issues =\r\nwith resource and path name mismatches when the software is installed on =\r\na case-sensitive file system. For a decade and several product cycles =\r\nAdobe didn't fix that, even though there were many bug reports about the =\r\nmatter and even though Apple emphasized several times on various =\r\noccasions at WWDC that developers shouldn't make any assumptions on the =\r\nnature of the file system that the system is installed.\r\n\r\nAdobe didn't (want to) get it. They just wanted to continue milking =\r\ntheir old pre-OS9 code base for as long as possible. I wish Apple would =\r\nuse some of their war chest to produce true competitors to Adobe's crap =\r\nthat are reasonably priced. Adobe charges up the wazoo, and didn't care =\r\nto be a good platform citizen, and were it not for the 64-bit =\r\ntransition, they'd still ship old, buggy Carbon based code. Barf! I'm =\r\nglad Jobs finally said it and broke with corporate politeness.=\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
