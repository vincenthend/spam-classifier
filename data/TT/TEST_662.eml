But as far as main idea of automounting is\r\n"easy (un)plug" (in my opinion at least), we have little weird but\r\nworking principle "sync, then unplug, and udev will carry out\r\neverything else". As I already said, it\'s really weirds, but it works.\r\n\r\nBut all you said made me hard thinking about the way I mount and\r\nunmount my removable media. Maybe I should forget about sync and use\r\n\'umount /mnt/sd[a-z]\' instead, or even write little script which will\r\nask me which device I want to unmount=E2=80=A6 Dunno. But thanks for sharin=\r\ng\r\nyour thoughts with me!\r\n\r\nP.S. Camale=C3=B3n, please forgive me for sending previous mail directly to\r\nyou, not to the list. I think it\'s time to drop GMail web interface\r\nand switch back to local email client=E2=80=A6\r\n\r\nWith best regards,\r\nAlexander Batischev\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
