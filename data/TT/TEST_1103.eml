It was fucking BRILLIANT. Do you know what exposure that got\nthem? They sat perfectly so that the cameras could focus on the mildly \nexasperated Rumsfeld and their "UN Inspections not war" banner. That picture\nwill be dominating the news cycles in China, Iraq, Russia, Germany, and \nFrance, at least. For goodness sakes, you\'re arguing about it on FoRK.
