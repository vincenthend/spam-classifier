I\'ve been using another 6.x repository though.\nhttp://apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org/apt\n\nAnyone tried (dist-)upgrade from 6.x to 7? Theoretically it should drop\nin some -compat\'s (notably libc) and upgrade the rest and after a reboot\nand maybe a new kernel (and grub, but I have long before put those to\nv6\'s :) run just fine. Haven\'t had a spare machine to try it on myself,\nthough.\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: Zoot apt/openssh & new DVD playing doc'}
