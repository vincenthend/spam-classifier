If you\r\n> have any doubts in SWF just use other format.\r\n\r\nWhat I wanted to say is that in the event I had to choose a format for \r\ndelivering my work, I -for sure- wouldn\'t go for Flash, although Adobe \r\nclaims is "open".\r\n\r\nOTOH, as many others have pointed out, Flash format maybe now open, but \r\n"players" are still in a very bad shape (and I am not talking about Gnash/\r\nswfdec, but Adobe\'s own flash player for linux). It\'s crappy and buggy.\r\n\r\nSo the reality is that anyone wanting to view a flash based site has to \r\nhave Adobe Flash player installed as is the only one able to fully \r\nsupport all the features listed in their "open" specs.\r\n\r\nAnd the same situation goes for Adobe Reader for Linux. I dunno what is \r\ngoing on with Adobe but true is that I dislike the path is taking that \r\ncompany :-/\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\n\r\n-- \r\nCamale\xc3\xb3n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
