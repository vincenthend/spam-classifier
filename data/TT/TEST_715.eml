Just be sure to remember which dev=\r\nice=20\r\nneeds replacing for when your new HW arrives.\r\n=2D-=20\r\nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr.           \t ,=3D ,-_-. =3D.\r\nbss@iguanasuicide.net            \t((_/)o o(\\_))\r\nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy \t `-\'(. .)`-\'\r\nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/        \t     \\_/\r\n', 'subject': 'Re: Questions about RAID 6'}
