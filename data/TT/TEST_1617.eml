My 6 year old Dell Latitude D800 on the\r\nother hand, while weighing in about 3 times as much, is solid as a brick and\r\nthe screen has no flex.

I question their durability for using while\r\ntravelling though, which is kinda the whole point of the netbooks...\r\n\r\nMark\r\n', 'subject': 'Re: 64-bit netbooks with Debian linux'}
