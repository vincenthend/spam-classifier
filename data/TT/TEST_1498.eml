Bush is under\nconsiderable strain. Not only do the two disagree on Yassir Arafat's\ntenure as leader of the Palestinian Authority, but Blair has started\ntelling disparaging anecdotes about the President.\n\nBaroness Williams of Crosby recalled a story told to her by 'my good\nfriend Tony Blair' recently in Brighton. Blair, Bush and Jacques\nChirac were discussing economics and, in particular, the decline of\nthe French economy. 'The problem with the French,' Bush confided in\nBlair, 'is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.'\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nR\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n", 'subject': 'Entrepreneurs'}
