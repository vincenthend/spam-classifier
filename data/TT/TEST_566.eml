We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is\nthe\n> Source of Love, and Who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend of all\nthat\n> are sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts.\nAmen."\n> \n> Twain wrote the story, "The War Prayer," in 1905 during the American\n> occupation of the Philippines, but the story wasn\'t printed until\n1923,\n> thirteen years after his death, because the editors thought it\n> "unsuitable"\n> for publication at the time it was written.\n> \n> #  distributed via <nettime>: no commercial use without permission\n> #  <nettime> is a moderated mailing list for net criticism,\n> #  collaborative text filtering and cultural politics of the nets\n> #  more info: majordomo@bbs.thing.net and "info nettime-l" in the msg\nbody\n> #  archive: http://www.nettime.org contact: nettime@bbs.thing.net\n> \n> --- end forwarded text\n> \n> \n> --\n> -----------------\n> R.
