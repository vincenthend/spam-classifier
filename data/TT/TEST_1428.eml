An interesting issue\nmight be how it affects employment.\n\nStill, it is a 1% or less sales tax.  That might not make that big of a\ndifference.  \n\nThe costs of tracking revenue and collecting the tax might be onerous.\nWorse than the cost of the tax itself.\n\nMe: I hate coffee anyway.  But if they put a $.10/can tax on Diet Dr.\nPepper I might have to start buying them in Oregon.  (Yes, I drink that\nmuch Diet Dr. Pepper).\n\n\n", 'subject': 'RE: Re[2]: Goodbye Global Warming'}
