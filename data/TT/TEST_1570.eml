{'body': '\n[can\'t think of how I\'d be running\nafoul of the spam filters with this\npost, so here\'s the second try...]\n\nKissinger\'s book _Does America Need\na Foreign Policy?_ provides a few\nhandy abstractions:\n\n> The ultimate dilemma of the statesman is to strike a balance between\n> values ["idealism"] and interests ["realism"] and, occasionally,\n> between peace and justice.\n\nAlso, he views historical American\napproaches to foreign policy as a\nbundle of three fibers:\n\nHamiltonian - We should only get\n  involved in foreign adventures\n  to preserve balances of power.\n\nWilsonian - We should only get\n  involved in foreign adventures\n  to further democracy, etc.\n\nJacksonian - We should never get\n  involved in foreign adventures.\n  Unless we\'re attacked.  Then we\n  go Rambo.\n\nHe has tactfully left out the hard\nrealists*; as for the rest I gather\nwilsonians play the idealists, and\nhamiltonians act where values and\ninterests intersect, and jacksonians \nact only when values and interests\noverlap.\n\nKissinger himself seems to be a\nHamiltonian; much of the book is\nabout how he thinks we ought to\nbe shaping the balance of power\nin various foreign regions.\n\nMaybe I\'ve been too affected by\nKant, but I can\'t see that such\na strategy works unless one can\ncount on a Bismarck runnning it:\nhow lopsided does the US look if\neveryone tries to run a balance\nof power politics?\n\n- -Dave\n\n*\n> The road to empire leads to domestic decay because, in time, the claims\n> of omnipotence erode domestic restraints.

In other\ntraditions, a king is a legitimate\ntyrant, and a tyrant an illegitimate\nking.  In the US, I\'d hope that we,\nlike Samuel, wouldn\'t naturally make\nsuch fine distinctions.\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Kissinger'}
