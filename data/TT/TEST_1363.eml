{'body': '> What I don\'t understand is why Ubuntu users *post* here, when they\r\n> actually run Ubuntu.\r\n\r\nI run Ubuntu and regularly read the Debian list, so maybe I can answer.\r\n\r\nIf I need to know where is the menus Firefox is, or how to change my\r\nwallpaper, the Ubuntu list is fine. But nobody there understands\r\n_anything_ about the OS. That is fine, the target audience of Ubuntu\r\nis not technical users. The barrier to entry is very low. My\r\n74-year-old mother in law uses Kubuntu.\r\n\r\nSo if the Debian support is so great, why do I run Ubuntu and not\r\nDebian? Several reasons. One, the low barrier to entry means that I\r\ncan get a system up and running in no time flat. Twice a year, 20\r\nminutes and I\'ve got the latest and greatest software versions. Debian\r\nstill needs tweaking for my problematic video card, and some other\r\nreally small details. But the biggest reason that I run Ubuntu is to\r\npromote it. I have done tens of installs for friends, neighbours, and\r\nfamily. I need to be familiar with what they are running. Debian just\r\nneeds a bit too much work, a bit too much handholding, and a bit too\r\nmuch explaining things.\r\n\r\nSo while my heart is with Debian, I run the best Debian derivative out there.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nDotan Cohen\r\n\r\nhttp://bido.com\r\nhttp://what-is-what.com\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
