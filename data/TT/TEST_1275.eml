I just looked at Intel, Asus, and other\r\nGigabyte boards and they all follow the correct alternating color pattern.\r\n\r\nAioanei, you\'ve based your entire argument on your knowledge of a single\r\nmain board.  This board was incorrectly manufactured, or the manual text is\r\nincorrect.  Yes, manufacturers do make mistakes.  Look at the ATA_HORKAGE\r\nblacklist sections in libata-core.c to see lists of hard drives the\r\nmanufacturers screwed up.  All of the Goliaths are in there, Hitachi,\r\nMaxtor, Seagate, Western Digital.  They\'re all shipped drives that don\'t\r\nmeet one spec or another.  If these Goliaths can screw up, I guarantee you a\r\ntiny company like Gigabyte can, and probably does so far more often.\r\n\r\nNow, go look at the DIMM socket colors and layout pattern on the Intel,\r\nAsus, and yes, other Gigabyte boards to see what the proper color coding for\r\ndual channel memory sockets is, and look at the text descriptions of the\r\nslot and channel numbers.  This GA board is an anomaly, and is flawed in\r\nthis regard.\r\n\r\nTake a look at the RHS of my email address.  That\'s my personal domain.\r\nThey call me TheHardwareFreak for a reason. ;)\r\n\r\nThe odds against me making a factually incorrect statement here about\r\nhardware are so high you should place a standing bet with your local bookie. :P\r\n\r\n-- \r\nStan\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
