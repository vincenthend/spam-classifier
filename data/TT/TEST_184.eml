I only use headless and Xless boxes so I have not\r\nlooked into whether the kernel uses grub2\'s GRUB_GFXMODE OR\r\nGRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX variables to set the video mode. KMS can be\r\nturned off in grub.cfg with either "nomodeset" (possibly superceded)\r\nor "<video>.modeset=0" where video=i915|i945|nouveau|radeon... but I\r\nhave only gleaned this from reading Fedora and Ubuntu stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
