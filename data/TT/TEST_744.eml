In reality, the probability of my \r\naccidental participation in distribution of the software is probably \r\npretty low, but I can certainly see the principle involved.\r\n\r\n> I wouldn\'t want to be stuck without non-free available, but I recommend making\r\n> hardware purchases that allow you to avoid non-free as much as possible.

And, as I said, \r\nI\'m also just genuinely interested in seeing how well I can do without \r\nthe proprietary bits. The resolve is made all the stronger by my \r\nexperiences in industry where I see what I think are some pretty unwise \r\ndecisions being made by companies who are often unwittingly tying their \r\nfortunes irrevocably to the whims (business models, I think they call \r\nthem) of other companies -- companies whose interests might (and do) run \r\nin a counter direction.\r\n\r\nThe industries I\'ve worked in might not have had very many choices (at \r\nleast without incurring huge development costs) when making their \r\nhardware / software decisions. But, as an individual, I can do what I \r\ndanged well please -- even if others may think that it looks like I\'m \r\njust cutting off my nose to spite my face.\r\n\r\n;)\r\n\r\n> [1] "Firmware" here is specifically limited to executable data transmitted to\r\n> the device from a host operating system, and does not include executable data\r\n> loaded from an EEPROM (or similar) that is provided with the device.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
