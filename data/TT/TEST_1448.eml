It is a vauluable and reliable service,\r\n\r\nValuable yes, since it provides useful video processing apps. I\'m using\r\nit also since recently. It probably is reliable, although for me it did\r\n  break vlc the moment I started using it.\r\n\r\n> and is provided by a well-known Debian developer.\r\n\r\nGood to know.\r\n\r\nHow come there is no link anywhere on debian.org pointing to\r\ndebian-multimedia.org? Anything to establish a chain of trust. As it is,\r\nI looked and looked but didn\'t find. Even when searching for\r\n"multimedia" on debian.org, it does not mention debian-multimedia.org at\r\nall. Not even when searching for "debian-multimedia". Every new debian\r\nuser trying to verify the credibilitiy of debian-multimedia.org would\r\nhave given up at this point for sure.\r\n\r\nWith the information that Marillat is a Debian developer (and the\r\nprecise spelling of his name) I was actually able to go to the\r\ndeveloper\'s page on debian org, find him, and see a link to d-m. So in a\r\nvery roundabout way, d-m is actually endorsed by debian.org. But how\r\nwould anybody find out about this in a reasonable amount of time?\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.9 (GNU/Linux)\r\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\r\n\r\niEYEARECAAYFAkvMyOsACgkQ+VSRxYk4409xCwCgiXo8AS/wA8db8M2SP4Kv3c2l\r\nknAAnA2Xq8lPi6RtGd06yiMcbrMe45Ih\r\n=Kc7/\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
