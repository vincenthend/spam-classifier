It\'s made for debian but it isn\'t debian.\r\n\r\nI started using d-mm.o from the reply to a question I posted in this\r\nlist many years ago and I suspect most people still find it today the\r\nsame way.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
