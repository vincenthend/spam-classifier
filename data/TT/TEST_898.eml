The subscription rate is\n$12 a year. They need 3,000 subscriptions to move forward (no word if\nexisting subscriptions will be honored, or included in the 3,000).\n[0]Read the site for more details.\n\nI think some of the more interesting notes are that it will include "a\nhealthy dose of opinion", as well a broadening of coverage including\nlanguages other than Perl (will this mean a name change?) and platforms\nother than Unix (I\'d always thought one of TPJ\'s strengths was that it\ncovered a wide variety of platforms).\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=02/09/12/026254\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.tpj.com/\n\n\n\nCopyright 1997-2002 pudge.
