The memory was installed by the=\r\n=20\r\nshop where I bought the components of my computer.  (I was intending to bui=\r\nld=20\r\nit myself and he didn\'t trust me with the CPU or memory!!)  He told me taht=\r\n I=20\r\nhad dual channel memory installed, and would need to replace both 256 Mb=20\r\nsticks if I increased the memory capacity.\r\n\r\nI have never seen any sign of dual channel operation. (Tho\' I didn\'t know w=\r\nhat=20\r\nto look for, which hardly helped!)\r\n\r\ndmidecode gives:\r\n\r\nMemory Device\r\n       [snip]\r\n        Size: 256 MB\r\n        Form Factor: DIMM\r\n        Set: None\r\n        Locator: A0\r\n        Bank Locator: Bank0/1\r\n        [snip]\r\n\r\nMemory Device\r\n        [snip]\r\n        Size: No Module Installed\r\n        Form Factor: DIMM\r\n        Set: None\r\n        Locator: A1\r\n        Bank Locator: Bank2/3\r\n        [snip]\r\n\r\nMemory Device\r\n        [snip]\r\n        Size: 256 MB\r\n        Form Factor: DIMM\r\n        Set: None\r\n        Locator: A2\r\n        Bank Locator: Bank4/5\r\n       =20\r\nWould I be correct in taking this to mean  that the memory modules appear t=\r\no=20\r\nbe incorrectly installed, and that I could improve my memory performance by=\r\n=20\r\nmoving one of the modules that dual channel functions?
