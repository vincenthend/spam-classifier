The above works, but without the double quotes: i.e.\n>\n> sh -c \'for f in `folders -recurse -fast` ; do sortm +"$f" ; done\'\n\nI may have a different version of "sh" than you do; the double quotes\naround the backticks work for my "sh".\n\n(In the more-than-you-really-wanted-to-know category, you\'re probably\nsafe without the double quotes.  The only reason I put them in is that\nI have some pathologically-named folders, including folders whose\nnames contain spaces.  If all your folders have safe names, you don\'t\nneed special quoting.)\n\n\n -Jacob\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-users mailing list\nExmh-users@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: Sorting'}
