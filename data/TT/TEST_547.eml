If this is your version, \r\naqd your Desktop, have a look at the LXDE documentation on \r\nhttp://www.lxde.org/\r\nYou could also ask for help on the LXDE forum (same url as above).\r\n\r\nxavier\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-kde-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
