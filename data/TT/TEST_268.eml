Like Woody Allen said, 90% of life is\nshowing up, right?\n\n\nAlmost anyone can find a church where the sermons don\'t make you bust\nout laughing, and you\'re set. I, for instance, am a Unitarian, which,\nas someone once observed, is merely a decompression chamber between a\nreal church and a golf course. (ObUUJokes: Mid 70\'s bumper-sticker:\n"Honk if you\'re not sure"; Lenny Bruce: "Did you hear about how the\nKlan burned a question mark on the Unitarian\'s lawn?"; "Unitarians\nwould rather go to a discussion group about heaven than to heaven\nitself."; "Unitarians pray \'to whom it may concern\'"; etc...)\n\nBut, seriously, folks, my teenage-adopted denomination (I\'m, um,\nlapsed, on several fronts, a Dutch-Reformed-turned-atheist father and\nan agnostic mother who used to be a southern Baptist of some stripe\nor another) and frankly limousine liberal secular-humanist\ncongregation is about as orthogonal to my present\ncongenital-Republican small-l libertarian turned anarchocapitalist\npolitics as it is possible to be (except for the secular-humanist\nbit...), and I still go pretty regularly, though not as much as I\nused to. Heck, the older I get the less of the divine I believe in.\nI\'m asymptotically approaching my father\'s atheism, these days, and I\nshow up at least once a month. Nice folks though, when I can keep a\ncivil tongue in my head -- smart too, when I can\'t and end up arguing\nwith them. :-).\n\n\nAnyway, if *I* can end up hitched, anyone can. Talk about orthogonal.\nI met my practically-socialist state-education-bureaucrat wife one\nyear after I started, moved in with her 6 weeks later :-), married\nher 2 years after that, and I wasn\'t even trying meet women. I was\njust looking to make friends as I was new in town.\n\n\nThe trick to the church thing is, whatever denomination/congregation\nyou end up in, expect to end up with a mate, not a date. I mean, some\nguys manage to stay single, but most, like me, don\'t. You can\npractically see the laser-sights light up when you walk into a\nroom...\n\nThat\'s because, of course, most churches are *run* by women. Most\nregular attendants are women. Hell, 65% of all new *ministers*, in\nprotestant denominations, at least, are women. No matter your age,\nlooks, intelligence, whatever, you\'ll end up surrounded by women.\nYou\'ll be outnumbered, even several to one -- some of whom are at\nleast better looking than you are. :-). The only place where there\nare *more* women running things is in grass-roots Republican politics\n- -- but I won\'t go there, I promise.\n\n\nIf I may make a presumption here, since you brought it up, I figure\nthat between the sophistication and diversity of the subcontinent\'s\nreligions, and the ubiquity of Indians in various stages of\nassimilation in So/NoCal, you can find some place to hang out near\nyou, Rohit. You probably don\'t even have to go, um, native, like I\ndid -- backsliding on my own ostensibly rational godless upbringing\nand becoming, horrors, a Unitarian...\n\nCheers,\nRAH\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: PGP 7.5\n\niQA/AwUBPYjCBcPxH8jf3ohaEQI2vwCbB2UkMyii/XwKQvvJFSWlMMRheBsAmwUB\njDmfQrNRQED3LmW6V8YutN54\n=vQ/A\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.
