{'body': "\nThanks for the great work Mathias but I would like to point out that this\nlist is fastly become the apt-rpm-list instead of the rpm-list. The\ndiscussion concerning apt is overwhelming. Maybe another list is in order\nfor those having trouble with apt-rpm. apt-rpm-hotline@freshrpms.net ? :)\n\nThough I think apt-rpm is a great tool, I don't use it and would like to\nget back to talk of new packages and rpm building techniques.\n\ndTd\nDaniel T.
