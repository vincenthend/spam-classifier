{'body': 'URL: http://boingboing.net/#85515860\nDate: Not supplied\n\nRob "Pringles Can" Flickenger and others Cliff Skolnik at the O\'Reilly OS X con \nhas tracked down the cause of the annoying flakiness in the wireless network \nhere -- every 20 or 30 seconds, you start getting "connection refused" messages \nfrom your browser and other net-utilities. Rob "Pringles Can" Flickenger wrote \nit up. \n\nIt turns out that running the great network-spy app Etherpeg[1] (or other \n"promiscuous" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in OS X at the same \ntime causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your \nsegment of the wireless network and respond to it with a "rejected" message. \n\nSo today, Rob (and everyone else who knows about this) is going to run around \nand tell people running Etherpeg to _turn off the firewall_ (and vice-versa). \nAh, fickle networking, you are such a stern mistress!
