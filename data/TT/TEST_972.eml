It actually\r\nworks, and is documented, although it\'s still pretty much in the\r\nproof-of-concept stage:\r\n\r\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/tmta/\r\n\r\nOne important thing that it does *not* (yet?) do is fork; it\'s currently\r\nimplemented as a basic, single-threaded daemon, so it can only accept\r\none connection at a time.  It shouldn\'t be too difficult (famous last\r\nwords ...) to convert into a multi-threaded model, although I have no\r\nexperience with that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nIt is still small, though - under 70 lines of actual Perl code,\r\nalthough it does, of course, require the basic Perl installation and\r\nabout a half-dozen other modules.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any feedback, or suggestions for improvement, I\'d love\r\nto hear them.\r\n\r\nCelejar\r\n-- \r\nfoffl.sourceforge.net - Feeds OFFLine, an offline RSS/Atom aggregator\r\nmailmin.sourceforge.net - remote access via secure (OpenPGP) email\r\nssuds.sourceforge.net - A Simple Sudoku Solver and Generator\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
