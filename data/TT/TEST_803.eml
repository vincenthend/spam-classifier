I go there mainly\r\nfor the HOWTOs if I want to research a specific subject.  But for\r\nhow to perform typical daily computing tasks using Linux, The Linux\r\nCookbook is the best that I have found.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you want to do that?  Here, type this ..."\r\n\r\nThat\'s the kind of everyday usage question that the Linux Cookbook was\r\ndesigned to solve.  And the second edition is even better.\r\nUnfortunately, it\'s not available online.  But I liked the original\r\nso well that I bought a hard copy of the second edition.\r\n\r\n-- \r\n  .\'\'`.
