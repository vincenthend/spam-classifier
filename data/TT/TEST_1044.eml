Presumably that counts as non-Debian.\r\n\r\n> Another thing to try is to activate the desktop icons for removable\r\n> devices and test if users can mount the devices by clicking on the\r\n> icons.\r\n\r\nSorry to sound stupid, but how do I activate those? Right now I don\'t\r\nsee any icons on the desktop when plugging devices in.\r\n\r\n> I suspect that the fstab entry is not really a problem.

I\'ll explore with it and\r\nreport if I find something interesting.\r\n\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.9 (GNU/Linux)\r\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\r\n\r\niEYEARECAAYFAkvDqA4ACgkQ+VSRxYk4408SyACeLV3a1tt3VKgvTwya+oBz71Nu\r\nIgQAn0hgk+w/0ykMQB/vtjNRf1oeLyib\r\n=3B0A\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
