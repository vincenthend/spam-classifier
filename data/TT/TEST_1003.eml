Only Ksensors\r\nand KPackage require KDE.  You say, "no way to keep all of KDE..".  I\r\ndon\'t care about all of KDE.  I only want KDM and the utilities I\r\nlisted above, plus of course the terminal servers.\r\n\r\n>>         Secondly, KPackage is badly broken.

Without KPackage, there really isn\'t much\r\nreason to run KDE.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-kde-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe". Trouble?
