The prom (ie the "ok" prompt) \nis almost at the hardware level and hence dosent depend on the os so you \nshould be able to connect to that easily enough. Once the machine is installed \ncant you just log in over the network? The network is the computer after all \n(sorry couldn\'t resist!)\n\nvalen@tuatha.org said:\n> side, Sun\'s terminal handling leaves a lot to be desired - it won\'t\n> work properly on a Wyse 120+ for instance, no matter what emulation\n> mode the Wyse is trying to do.\nhmm... I\'m not familiar with wyse stuff, but I only need to use the console \nwhen something breaks, then anything capable of something basic like vt100 at \n9600 8n1 seems to work  . Not sure why you\'d need to worry about this much \nreally, just set up jumpstart to install automatically then you don\'t need to \nlook at the console at all.\n\nCheers,\n~Al\n\n-- \nExpressed in this posting are my opinions.
