(Which is pretty much what you did.)\r\n\r\n> As for the reply bug, I just noticed it today; and no, I haven\'t\r\n> reported a bug yet.  I\'m not sure I\'m going to.  I already said why.\r\n\r\n  Indeed.  Still if it affects one site it probably affects others,\r\n unless it is caused by a particularly malformed\r\n HTML/javascript/whatever that site uses behind the scenes.\r\n\r\n  On that basis its useful to report, if only so that other users\r\n of that particular site can see it.\r\n\r\n  Even without that perhaps saving the page, and associated media\r\n to your local machine might still trigger it. If that is the case you\r\n can trim down the page(s) a lot and see if you can find out what causes\r\n it yourself.  (Assuming you\'re familiar with HTML & so on.)\r\n\r\nSteve\r\n--\r\nDebian GNU/Linux System Administration\r\nhttp://www.debian-administration.org/\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
