Weekly, Monthly, or just when you have  \r\na 'major' event?\r\nHow far in advance of your meeting do you send them? The day before? A  \r\nweek before? Two weeks before?\r\n\r\nDo you send HTML based emails? Or just Plain Text?\r\nDo you keep an archive online of your past Press Releases on your  \r\nwebsite?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a PR mailing list, why don't you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASE REPLY TO THE *_LIST_* so everyone can benefit from your  \r\nresponses :)\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nNicholas Pyers (nicholas@appleusers.org)\r\nFounder & Publisher, AppleUsers.org\r\n\r\nhttp://www.appleusers.org/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
