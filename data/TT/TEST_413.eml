{'body': '\nRelated to the MS acquisition of XDegrees?\n\n==\nhttp://www.internetnews.com/infra/article.php/1466271\n\nSun Nabs Storage Startup\nBy Clint Boulton\nAmid the flurry of news at its own SunNetwork 2002 conference in San\nFrancisco, Sun Microsystems Thursday said it has agreed to purchase data\nstorage concern Pirus Networks for an undisclosed amount of stock.\n\nThe Palo Alto, Calif. networking firm bought the Acton, Mass.-based startup\nwith a keen eye for the startup\'s switching (define) devices and\nvirtualization technology. Used as part of a storage area network (define),\nvirtualization is the pooling of storage from many network storage devices\ninto what appears to the operating system to be a single storage device that\nis managed from a central console.\n\nThough major vendors make similar technology, Pirus competes with the likes\nof Rhapsody Networks and Confluence Networks. Sun plucked Pirus after\nscouting some 65 companies.\n\nMark Lovington, vice president of marketing for Pirus, told internetnews.com\nthat Pirus and Sun have been in discussion for a while about a possible\nacquisition. Pirus, he said, succeeded in a goal it shares with a lot of\nstorage startups -- to be acquired by one of the major systems vendors, such\nas Sun IBM, HP, Hitachi.\n\n"This is a huge opportunity for Pirus in a storage market dominated by 6,7\nor 8 system-level players," Lovington said. "Sun sees this acquisition as a\ncritical element to their N1 initiative. The synergies were quite obvious."\n\nN1 is Sun\'s hopeful tour de force in distributed computing (define)\narchitecture, which involves multiple, remote computers that each have a\nrole in a computation problem or information processing. N1 is being styled\nas the answer for companies looking to manage groups of computers and\nnetworks as a single system -- at a lower cost and with greater flexibility.\n\nWhile lagging behind other, more entrenched players, Sun is gaining ground\nin the storage market with its Sun StorEdge Complete Storage Solutions,\naccording to a new report by IDC. John McArthur, group vice president of\nIDC\'s Storage program, said Sun Microsystems and IBM posted the largest\nincreases in total storage revenue over Q1 2002, with 32% and 11% gains,\nrespectively. As of Q2, Sun held a 9 percent market share, with revenues of\n$411 million.\n\nSun\'s acquisition of Pirus is expected to close in the second quarter of\nSun\'s 2003 fiscal year, which ends December 29, 2002.\n\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Sun Nabs Storage Startup - buys Pirus Networks'}
