You need to follow the upgrade outline mentioned\r\nin the Release Notes.  You didn\'t say how you did it, and it\'s too late\r\nin any case, but I just wanted to mention that while we\'re on the subject.\r\n\r\nAssuming that you did the migration properly, this may be a device name\r\nissue.  There\'s been some problems with device names recently, particularly\r\nwith IDE hard disks.  It hasn\'t happened to me, but others have reported\r\ndevice names going from /dev/hdx to /dev/sdx and back again with\r\nsubsequent maintenance.  You may have to boot from a rescue disk,\r\nedit your /etc/fstab to change device names, according to what they\r\nare now, and rebuild your initial RAM file system.\r\n\r\nIf that is the issue, an alternative to traditional device names is\r\nto use UUIDs.\r\n\r\n--=20\r\n  .\'\'`.
