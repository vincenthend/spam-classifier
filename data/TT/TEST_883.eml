It\'s just that our culturally-induced focal-point causes most\nof us to most of the time ignore and waste 99.999% of it.  "Lucid" is\na measure of notch-filter bandwidth; all stations are broadcasting,\nbut we only /choose/ Easy Rock 105.\n\nFor example, don\'t look now but your shoes are full of feet.\n\nThe sensation of toes the above statement evokes is not a "turning on"\nof circuits, it is a "tuning in".  The next step, of course, is to\n"drop out" :)\n\nTo paraphrase an old saw: Life is wasted on the living.\n\n--\nGary Lawrence Murphy <garym@teledyn.com> TeleDynamics Communications Inc\n Business Advantage through Community Software : http://www.teledyn.com\n"Computers are useless.
