It has taken place annually since\r\n2000 in locations as varied as Canada, Finland, Mexico, Scotland, and\r\nArgentina. This year DebConf10 is in New York City, New York, USA.\r\n\r\nThis year, as every year, a great deal of the burden for the conference\r\nis placed on Debian volunteers who donate time and energy to organizing\r\nthe conference. Your help would be most welcome.
