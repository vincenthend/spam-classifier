{'body': 'I upgraded my Squeeze box to KDE 4.4 about a week ago, and have been \r\ncontending with jumpy, hesitant video performance ever since. I\'m not sure \r\nwhich package to file this bug against; if it helps I\'m running an Nvidia \r\n7900GS using the drivers in the nvidia-glx package. It ran fine with KDE 4.3. \r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nGene\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe". Trouble?
