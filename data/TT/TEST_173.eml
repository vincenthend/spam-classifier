{'body': 'Well, it wouldn\'t be my own vanity list if I didn\'t forward at least a \nlittle purely self-interested data.\n\nThis week is my Europe Week. In classic TRAVELMAN fashion, I\'m hitting \ntwo nights each in Paris, London, Hamburg, and Copenhagen.\n\nI get to cure Rob\'s brain-pains this weekend, though at risk of missing \nthe big concert in London Sunday :-(\n\n> Around Town\n> Channel 4\'s Indian Summer\n>\n> As England meets India in four test matches this Summer, Channel 4 \n> brings together a host of activities reflecting Indian life in a free \n> event held over the weekend (27/28 July). A huge screen in Regent\'s \n> Park will bring coverage of the first Test Match live from Lords \n> throughout the weekend. Marylebone Green will be the setting for a \n> chance to sample a mix of Indian food, music and film; an 8-piece \n> Indian-style brass band will be performing Bollywood tunes, and there \n> will be live DJ sets as well as performance by The Angel Dancers, who \n> have performed with Bollywood stars around the world. In the evening \n> (27), there will be an open-air screening of the comedy hit \'Monsoon \n> Wedding\'. A live concert by award-winning, British-Asian artist Nitin \n> Sawhney will bring the weekend to a climax on 28 July, with special \n> guests including Badmarsh & Shri and Asian Dub Foundation.\n>\n> 27-28 July, 10.30am-9pm, Marylebone Green, Regent\'s Park. Baker Street/ \n> Great Portland Street/ Regent\'s Park tube\n\nInstead, I\'m arriving in London on Monday morning, staying through a \nshow of Andrew Lloyd Weber\'s new production, Bombay Dreams\n\n> Bombay Dreams Set to be the latest in a long line of Andrew Lloyd \n> Webber smash hits comes \'Bombay Dreams\', based on the book by Meera \n> Syal, and lyrics by AR Rahman, whose last project was the \n> Oscar-nominated \'Lagaan\'. The project cost \xa34 million and doesn\'t \n> feature a single note of Lloyd Webber\'s music - which may or may not be \n> a good thing!\n>\n> Until 29 Sept, 7.45pm Mon-Tue & Fri, 3pm & 7.45pm.Wed & Sat, Apollo \n> Victoria, Wilton Road, SW1 (0870 4000 650). Victoria tube/rail.\n\nI\'ll be visiting a cousin-in-law (my cousin\'s visa is still in the \nworks... a looong process).\n\nThe next stop is to visit a cousin\'s family proper, and a niece I \nhaven\'t met since she was born 3-4 years ago. Should be a blast!\n\nFinally, Friday and Saturday of next week will be Copenhagen for \nHenrik\'s second wedding... to the same woman, tho! :-)\n\nBon voyage,\n   Rohit\n\nPS. Yes, it\'s egotistical to wish oneself a "Bon Voyage". Screw it, it\'s \nmy list, dammit!\n\n---\nMy permanent email address is khare@alumni.caltech.edu\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n', 'subject': "TRAVELMAN: if it's Tuesday, it must be London..."}
