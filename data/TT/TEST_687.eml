This was a server installed by some body else.\r\n\r\nThe folder limit was reached some time back.\r\n\r\nAs a temporary solution some directories were removed .\r\nThey will be fitting new drives tomorrow so I guess i will format them\r\nto XFS and use that.\r\n\r\nsince ext4 also has a limit ans jfs also has a limit of 64000 I guess\r\nI will use XFS which allows 2^32 directories under a directory.\r\n\r\nMy inclination to use JFS was because that is the file system that has\r\nproved stable for me during numerous crashes due to power failure back\r\nat home more than any other :-)\r\n\r\nThank you so much all of you for all the info.\r\n\r\n--Siju\r\n> Which file system can I use to over come it?\r\n> I am planning for JFS\r\n>\r\n> Does anybody has any recommendations?\r\n>\r\n> Thanks\r\n>\r\n> --Siju\r\n>\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
