{'body': 'I am continuing to suffer the on-going de-volution of the once-decent\r\nepiphany browser under Debian Squeeze.  First they broke file\r\ndownloading.  They still haven\'t fixed that.  I\'ll bet it\'s been\r\nsix months or more.\r\n\r\nNow I can\'t reply to any e-mails using the Wow basic\r\nwebmail client.  I click on the "Reply" button, the mail compose\r\nscreen appears for a fraction of a second, then I get this error\r\nscreen.  The problem does not occur with iceweasel.  The problem is\r\nvery recent.  It broke with a recent\r\n"aptitude update;aptitude full-upgrade" sequence.  I suppose I could\r\nreport a bug, but I\'m not about to give them my password so they\r\ncan logon as me to test it!  I\'m going back to iceweasel again.\r\nI kept using epiphany so I would know when the file download feature\r\ngot fixed.  Instead they broke something else.\r\n\r\n-- \r\n  .\'\'`.
