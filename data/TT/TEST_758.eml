{'body': 'The RIAA continues to amaze me.    Everyone might want to grok the\nnews yahoo has:\n\nhttp://rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/nm/tc_nm/inlinks/*http://Listen4ever.com\n\n\nAnd if you\'re really bored, go ahead and read the papers that were\nfiled by the RIAA against the major backbone providers.\n\nhttp://www.riaa.com/pdf/Listen4Ever.pdf\n\n\nSo it looks like the RIAA is getting bored with its usual tack of\nsuing the peer-to-peer services, and is instead using the DMCA\nto sue ISPs and backbones into compliance --  They want said backbones\nto block the ip address of the listen4ever.com server due to\nlisten4ever\'s alleged infringement of copyright.  To quote\nthe Motion that the RIAA issued:  "Plaintiffs request that\nthe Court issue a preliminary injunction requiring Defendants to block\ncommunication to and from Listen4ever\'s servers that travel through\nDefendants\' backbone routing systems".\n\nAt least according to the RIAA (probably for bonus terror tactics )\nthe Listen4ever site is even more formidable than that bane of p2p\ngoodness, Napster, due to the fact that its on a centralized server,\nout of their reach of RIAA/DMCA control (its located in China), and\nbecause according to the RIAA it facilitates the downloading of entire albums.\nApparently listen4ever has a few other sites floating around, and the RIAA has been\nunsuccessful in getting any of them to voluntarily surrender\nservice(1).\n\nGotta love the RIAA for jumping into this lawsuit with the customer\'s\ninterests in mind.  How lawyers can write drivel along the lines of\n\'if you dont stop these guys, we\'ll run out of money and we won\'t be\nable to supply you new music!\' just blows my mind, especially in this\nday and age.   The RIAA has enough money to file inane lawsuits\nagainst backbone providers, but they don\'t have enough money to\nproduce new artists?  Something seems wrong here.\n\nHere\'s my problem.  Say the RIAA wins in court, and the backbone\nproviders comply.   Their biggest hurdle is now accomplished, and one\nhell of a terrible precident is/can be set.   At least in the RIAA\'s\ncase, I\'m sure once they get a Court-mandated Ok for this particular\nsite, they\'ll just go ahead, write their nice friendly lawyer letters,\nand demand that subsequent IP addresses also be blocked, as they too\nroute to sites that are problematic to the RIAA.\n\nEven worse, the concept that other groups (the first that flashed into\nmy little brain being the Scientologists) also decide that this is the way\nto go.   If the RIAA prevails, they have record set, albiet in NY\nonly, that can be pointed back to, and used in other cases.\nEventually this will hit a large enough court that precident will set,\n and we have a very quiet, very non-reported event occuring from then\n on, the systematic C&Ding of the Internet.   Anything that violates the\nDMCA, given its takedown provisions, might now potentially\nfall prey to a Cease & Desist letter.  Rather than appealing, the\nbackbone providers will just agree -- as they seem likely to do\n\'provided a court order\'.\n\nPoint being is that soon this won\'t take a court order.  A nastygram\nwill suffice and we\'ll wonder where all the new\nmusic/information/dissenting opinions/ criticisms went.\n\nThis is a scary road we\'re running down here.   So nice to see that\nits still hush-hush in the geek community.\n\nWhats more bizzare is some of the support(?) that the RIAA seemed to\nget.   I\'m curious for instance, how Dave Farber got dragged into\nthis...  (2) Dave, you still read FoRK?\n\n(1) Save for one, lmp3.com, which was listed as a redirect site in the\ncourt documents, has since gone down.   Their website has a humorous little note:  "Lmp3\nwill be closed and will never come back! ".  Listen4ever.com is not\nresponding, but i\'m not quite sure if thats due to backbone compliance\nor the site being overburdened.\n\n(2) Declaration of Prof. David J. Farber:\nhttp://www.riaa.com/pdf/Listen4Ever.pdf (p. 95)\n\n\nA very disgruntled,\n\nbitbitch\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n', 'subject': 'This little domain went to China....'}
