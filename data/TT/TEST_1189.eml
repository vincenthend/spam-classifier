But to be fair, I appreciate the pipline idea; just as it\'s useful on the commandline, it\'ll be emensely powerful for manipulating multimedia, too.    It\'s just not EASY yet.  I\'m sure all kindsa glade-produced front-ends will come up for it soon, though.  And the docs are complete, too...\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Fahrl\xe4nder              Linux Zealot, Conservative, and Technomad\nEvansville, IN                    My Voyage: http://www.CounterMoon.com\nICQ  5119262\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"Waddling" into the mainstream?
