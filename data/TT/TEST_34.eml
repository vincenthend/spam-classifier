(I \r\nstill cringe about how I learned that md software raid does not always \r\nkick bad disks out of an array - if a drive is going bad, and just takes \r\nlots of tries to read data, everything just slows waaa....aaaay down.  \r\nAnd then unraveling logical volumes on top of software raid can get very \r\ninteresting.)
