But this is my primary machine and I want to keep it stable.  I\r\nalso don\'t have that much of a need any more to use the usb phone/modem.\r\nIf that changes, I might try a newer kernel.  In fact I might try a\r\nbackported kernel on another machine.  I\'ll report back when I do.\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe". Trouble?
