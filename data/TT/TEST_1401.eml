It can read right through\nmisspellings like the above without any difficulty.  And as the author\nabove suggested, the pattern matching is inherently parallel internally.\n\nIf the text recognition algorithm/architecture humans use is anything\nlike the algorithm/structure we've been working with, the reason the\nfirst letter (and to a lesser extent, the last letter) is important is\nthat without it the text pattern recognition problem is exponentially\nmore difficult (from a theoretical standpoint anyway) and has to be\nresolved using deeper abstraction analysis.  The middle letters are far\nless important and computationally much easier to resolve correctly.  \n\nCheers,\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\n", 'subject': 'Re: dylsexics of the wrold, untie!'}
