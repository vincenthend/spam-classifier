By integrating the advanced\n  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors\' secure P2P\n  collaboration network, Endeavors has created a new method of world-class\n  teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel.\n\n  With the rapid growth in popularity of Web meetings, the rationale for this\n  world-class relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around\n  the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience\n  between online meetings. The issue by those preferring not to travel is how\n  to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between\n  meetings rather than depending on intermittent, insecure email and multiple\n  copies of constantly changing documents.\n\n  Inter-meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium, independent of\n  time. In asynchronous mode, a team member can access, read and edit\n  information relevant to the meeting group at his/her convenience rather than\n  having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others. A secured\n  environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also\n  essential.\n\n  Endeavors\' Magi technology converts the Web into a secure platform for\n  sharing information directly from people\'s desktops. WebEx meetings can be\n  recorded and reviewed at any time, documents shared in the meeting can be\n  actioned in real-time or at a later date, calendars and project schedules\n  can be updated at any time, and new individuals added to the workgroup at\n  will . all in a secure environment with people working across the globe,\n  inside or outside company firewalls.\n\n  Magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to Web\n  meeting participants. Not only can they share and access information at\n  will, but they can also know which other participants are online or\n  "present." This enables them to chat and message each other, search across\n  other people\'s Magi environment, and work jointly on relevant documents\n  highly productively. With Magi collaboration, in tandem with WebEx\n  conferencing, the savings can be huge in terms of travel costs, phone bills,\n  and, most importantly, timely completion of projects and tasks.\n\n  "In order to realise the full potential of Web meetings, best-of-breed\n  services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries," says\n  Bernard Hulme, Tadpole\'s group chief executive. "The powerful combination\n  of Endeavors\' Magi and WebEx\'s communications technologies will assist\n  global work teams to better meet critical business goals and deadlines by\n  maintaining teamwork momentum within and between Web meetings."\n\n  "WebEx is transforming the way businesses use the Web for sales, marketing,\n  training, support and product design," says David Farrington, vice president\n  of corporate development at WebEx Communications. "By integrating the\n  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors\' secure\n  collaboration network, Endeavors has created an offering that provides the\n  best in synchronous and asynchronous communications."\n\n  About Magi\n  Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms\n  today\'s Web into a highly secure inter- and intra-enterprise collaboration\n  network of files and web resources.
