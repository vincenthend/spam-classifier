For the\r\nabove auto.master stanza you could use:\r\n  /var/autofs/usb /etc/auto.usb --timeout=### --ghost\r\n\r\nThis can lead to a cluttered /var/autofs/usb directory, however,\r\nunless you do some udev-based scripting to manage things on the fly.\r\n\r\ndt\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nDave Thayer           | Whenever you read a good book, it\'s like the \r\nDenver, Colorado USA  | author is right there, in the room talking to \r\ndave@thayer-boyle.com | you, which is why I don\'t like to read \r\n                      | good books. - Jack Handey "Deep Thoughts"\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
