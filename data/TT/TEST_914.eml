You can\'t do _everything_, the most limiting being\nthat you can\'t move the start of a partition, but it\'s quite powerful\nnevertheless, and I\'ve been very happy with it the few times I\'ve had to\nuse it.\n\n> >If you didn\'t put /home on a separate partition,\n> \n> With winbloze 9x I used to deltree the winbloze dir and some "Program\n> Files" dirs, and install "fresh" instead of upgrade, while saving my\n> other data.

For me that\'s only /etc/, /root/ and\n/home/. Then you reinstall cleanly, formating "/", put your /home/ files\nback into place and you\'re ready to go.\nThat\'s the moment I usually realize I had a nifty tweak to a file in\n/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ or some special parameters added to an\n/etc/modules.conf entry... so I look at my backup and make the same change\nagain. The only thing where you can get stuck is the grub.conf files,\nbecause although there\'s a /etc/grub.conf link, it\'s actually in\n/boot/grub/ so you may want to copy it too if you have special kernel\nparameters to save (I have to pass "pci=bios,biosirq" for one of my\ncomputers to work for example).\n\nHTH,\nMatthias\n\n-- \nMatthias Saou                                World Trade Center\n-------------                                Edificio Norte 4 Planta\nSystem and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, Spain\nElectronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: use new apt to do null to RH8 upgrade?'}
