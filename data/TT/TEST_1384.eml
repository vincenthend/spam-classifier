Like if\nyou absolutely detest qt and some programs are rebuildable from sources\nwith different %configure options. You can get src.rpm, edit spec, bump\nrelease numberwith your initials and another number and rebuild, insert\ninto apt and let loose... :)\n\nDoesn't freshrpms have updates dir too? Maybe not quite as up to date as\nup2date but still. I would never use up2date. There is another\nrepository at apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org IIRC. Not sure if that had The\nupdates.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n", 'subject': 'Re: apt and a hybrid system'}
