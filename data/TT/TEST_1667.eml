But the problems I had with Gnome and Xfce on this system \r\noccurred not only in Squeeze, but also when running an Ubuntu LTS \r\nversion and Debian Stable. I only saw those problems when using the \r\nrestricted / glx drivers. Never with nv or vesa. I think this is, \r\nperhaps, more a measure of the card itself than the drivers. But I know \r\na number of people with "high end" graphics cards from nvidia who have \r\nreported the same sorts of issues that I saw. It doesn\'t really matter \r\nmuch as these particular systems are no longer used as graphics \r\nworkstations. As they\'ve aged we stuck Linux on them and use them as \r\nadmin workhorses, a job for which they are admirably suited because of \r\nall of the screen real estate.\r\n\r\n> Regarding reliability of video drivers: Running many different things,\r\n> hardware- and driver-wise, over time, I have learned that\r\n> dpkg-reconfigure is your friend, especially\r\n>\r\n> dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-2.6.32-5\r\n>\r\n> which regenerates the initrd.img.

In my earlier experiences I would just wipe the drive and start \r\nover when I suspected that hangovers from previous experiments with \r\ndrivers were getting in the way of new configurations. But after I \r\nbecame comfortable with a few different methods of installation and \r\ninitial configuration I started paying attention to things like \r\ndpkg-reconfigure and debconf-show.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
