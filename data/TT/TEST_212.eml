The=\r\ny=20\r\nmight tell us why your filesystem is not getting cleanly re-mounted read-on=\r\nly.\r\n\r\n> > I also have 4+ tebibytes but most of them are allocated to filesystems.\r\n> >  I\'ve\r\n> > had to shrink filesystems dozens of times since 2005, during or after a\r\n> > data\r\n> > move.\r\n>=20\r\n> I\'ve had to extend on the fly many more times than I have had to reduce.\r\n\r\nYes.  Many, many more times.  A filesystem that can\'t grow is beyond useles=\r\ns=20\r\nfor me.  Luckily btrfs support growing and shrinking and it can do both whi=\r\nle=20\r\nmounted.  On-line shrinking is a trick I couldn\'t get reiser3 to perform.\r\n=20\r\n> >  I\'m hoping to be able to move that onto LVM once I move to\r\n> > GRUB2 and GPT.\r\n>=20\r\n> You know, /boot on bare drive has never bothered me, especially since I u=\r\nse\r\n> encrypted filesystems on everything but VMs. On laptops, I had it set up =\r\nso\r\n> /boot lived on a thumb drive...So I\'m cool with it.\r\n\r\nWell, I will still have to have a "partition" for GRUB to embed stage 1.5 i=\r\nf I=20\r\ngo with GPT.  However, it won\'t contain files per se.  I like having as muc=\r\nh=20\r\nas possible on LVM because it makes it easier to migrate to new storage med=\r\nia=20\r\nand retire the old media.\r\n=2D-=20\r\nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr.           \t ,=3D ,-_-. =3D.\r\nbss@iguanasuicide.net            \t((_/)o o(\\_))\r\nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy \t `-\'(. .)`-\'\r\nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/        \t     \\_/\r\n', 'subject': 'Re: Filesystem recommendations'}
