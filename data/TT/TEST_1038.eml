It\'s easy to use and install.\r\nThe guests OS that I tried and work: Debian, MEPIS, OpenSolaris, \r\nOpenSuse, Solaris 10, XP and some other Linux distros. DesktopBSD and \r\nFreeBSD work but can\'t get GUI -that can be lack of my knowledge.\r\n\r\nSame with open VirtualBox except I think that there is no USB support.\r\n\r\nAqemu (qemu) easy to use and install -DesktopBSD work\'s with GUI.\r\n\r\nI think that all VM have file sharing, printing depends on USB if you \r\nhave USB printer.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nBye,\r\nGoran Dobosevic\r\nHrvatski: www.dobosevic.com\r\n  English: www.dobosevic.com/en/\r\nRegistered Linux User #503414\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
