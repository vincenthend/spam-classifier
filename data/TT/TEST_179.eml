However,\r\n> I\'ve just bought a new 1080p TV and connected it to the computer via HDMI.\r\n> This unfortunately has permanently knocked the resolution down on the\r\n> monitor to 800x600, which is next to unusable. Would anyone with a similar\r\n> configuration be willing to share an xorg.conf or share some advice on this.\r\n> I think I\'d like the monitor to be either 1280x960, 1152x864, 1024x768 and\r\n> the TV to work at 1600x900 1366x768 or 1280x720.\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> Thanks for any help!\r\n> Jim\r\n>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
