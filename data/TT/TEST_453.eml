Yes, fine, there's trinity, but as far\r\nas anybody can tell, that's just one guy.  I'm sure you could find one\r\nguy somewhere out there still hacking on Linux 2.2 or something equally\r\ndead.  Doesn't make it any less dead.\r\n\r\nYES, you can have KDE 3.5!  You can even have it as an official part of\r\nDebian!  Nobody will stop you!  However,  you will need to do some work.\r\nYou will need to make sure that there is sufficient upstream developer\r\ncommittment to keep it usable and current, and you will need to make\r\nsure there is a sufficiently motivated packaging team to keep up with\r\nupstream work, triage bugs, and cooridinate package updates with\r\nupstream, the the release teams, the security team, etc etc.  Can you do\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nnoah\r\n\r\n", 'subject': 'Re: Fwd: Re: Kde 3.5 ...'}
