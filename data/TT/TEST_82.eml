If you move the mouse cursor into the \r\nwindow that pops up, hold it still there and click the middle button, \r\nyou should see something like this:\r\n\r\nButtonPress event, serial 26, synthetic NO, window 0x400001,\r\n     root 0x381, subw 0x0, time 208302587, (103,133), root:(107,155),\r\n     state 0x0, button 2, same_screen YES\r\n\r\nButtonRelease event, serial 26, synthetic NO, window 0x400001,\r\n     root 0x381, subw 0x0, time 208302722, (103,133), root:(107,155),\r\n     state 0x200, button 2, same_screen YES\r\n\r\nIf it says button 2, your X11 setup is okay. If not, please run this \r\ncommand and tell us the output:\r\n\r\n   defaults read org.x.x11\r\n\r\nIf your xev run does give you button 2 events, then there is probably \r\nsomething wrong with your window manager setup.\r\n\r\n- Harald\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
