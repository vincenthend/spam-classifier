I find the package manager t=\r\nhat=20\r\nUbuntu shares with Debian to be enough of an advantage to put it above othe=\r\nr=20\r\nsolutions like RHEL or SLE(D/S).\r\n\r\nI am comfortable enough to use and maintain RHEL and SLE(S/D) in fairly sim=\r\nple=20\r\nenvironments, if the user has some specific need for one of those systems. =\r\n=20\r\nThat\'s rare, but is often related to third-party hardware or software being=\r\n=20\r\ncertified with one of those.\r\n=2D-=20\r\nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr.           \t ,=3D ,-_-. =3D.\r\nbss@iguanasuicide.net            \t((_/)o o(\\_))\r\nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy \t `-\'(. .)`-\'\r\nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/        \t     \\_/\r\n', 'subject': 'Re: Joke'}
