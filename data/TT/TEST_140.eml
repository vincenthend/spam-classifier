Even if you had retained your 2002-era BNR\r\nknowledge, the prevailing use of framework-provided view controllers\r\nin UIKit is a pretty significant change with lots of interesting (and\r\nmostly very positive) consequences.  Even some Cocoa old-timers had a\r\nhard time grasping it at first--I\'m living proof!  That being said, I\r\ndon\'t know if BNR is covering a lot of iPhone material now (though I\r\nassume that\'s the case) or if they\'re still more Mac-focused, so check\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n-- \r\n// jack\r\n// http://nuthole.com\r\n// http://learncocoa.org\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
