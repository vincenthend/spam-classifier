HTML would\nprobably be the best format for use with Plucker/SiteScooper, depending\non how good the DOC --> HTML conversion is.  i haven\'t used either in\nover a year as AbiWord or OpenOffice work well enough.  (prefer AbiWord\nfor it\'s light-weight size, but OpenOffice has the better DOC importer.)\n\ndon\'t know which of these are better or worse than the other, but i\nfigure, "the more the merrier". ;-)\n\n> You could also try openoffice and/or abiword if you\n> have x installed.\n\nAbiWord supports exporting to PalmDoc (.pdb) which is about as\nPalmOS-friendly as you can get.  never tried/needed it, but it\'s listed\nthere in the "Save As" dialog box.\n\nWine (or CrossOver Office, if you already have it) may support Word\nViewer (free download from Microsoft), but didn\'t a year or so ago when\ni last tried.  Word Viewer is what i used back in the day to convert\nWord 97 docs to Word 95, as you could display the Word 97 doc and copy &\npaste the text (with formatting) into Word 95, which was the only\nversion of Word that i had.  anyways, a little nostalgia.\n\n> > I don\'t have a Windows machine, so it becomes problematic to convert them;\n> > I know that if this were not the case, in Word I could save them as some\n> > other more friendly format.\n\ni have a windows (dual-boot) machine, but it only get used by my\nsignificant other and for burning multi-session cd-r/rw.  (is there any\nlinux gui app that supports cdrecord\'s multi-session feature?)  since\nOpenOffice, i\'ve been able to edit Word docs flawlessly (or at least the\nsimple Word documents i receive from others).\n\nanyways...\n-- \n\nPLEASE REQUEST PERMISSION TO REDISTRIBUTE\n   AUTHOR\'S COMMENTS OR EMAIL ADDRESS.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old\ncell phone?
