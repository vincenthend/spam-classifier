{'body': "Hi,\n\nThis might appear as a very strange email. Maybe it is ;)\n\nI'm french, and I'm currently studying in a engineer school in France,\ncalled UTBM (http://www.utbm.fr). Next year, from February to July, I have\nto do a practice somewhere in the world (in France or elsewhere).\n\nI'm a Linux user and developer since a couple of years now (I coordinate the\nKOS project, http://kos.enix.org). That's why I'm looking for a practice in\nwhich I can use Linux and/or develop Linux/BSD Software. I also prefer\nworking in a small company (< 100 people). But since I've never been to\nIreland (that's why I want to discover this country), and since I have no\ncontact there, it is very difficult to find companies.\n\nSo, I thought that the local Linux community maybe was able to help me by\ngiving some list of companies that are known to work with Linux/BSD or any\nother free software.\n\nThank you very much for your help\n\nThomas\n\nThomas Petazzoni\nthomas.petazzoni@non.hp.com\nKOS : http://kos.enix.org\nPerso : http://kos.enix.org/~thomas/ \n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n", 'subject': '[ILUG] Training in Ireland ?'}
