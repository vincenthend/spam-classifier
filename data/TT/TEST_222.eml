Much the \nsame as when the manuals on "modular coding" said to write modules that \nwould fit on a single sheet of computer paper, lots of coders proceeded \nto split their code into arbitrary 60-line chunks. :)\n\nHowever, "Go-to considered harmful" points out that to analyse (==debug) \ncode, you need to be able to tell what the point of execution is, and \nwhat the values of the variables are at that point. This is an easy(tm) \njob if the code uses assignment, if(), for() and functions, but not if \nit uses GOTO. (See http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD215.PDF \nfor the full letter).\n\nDespite being one of Dijkstra\'s brain-damaged children who learned BASIC \nat an early age :) I never use GOTO anymore (or any of its bastard \noffspring like break, continue, fudged function calls with sleight of \nhand in the variables). My code is longer than it might be if I had used \nGOTO at a critical, handy point. However, code is a bit like networks - \nyou always end up adding bits on where you didn\'t expect to - and the \nbenefit is felt when another person (like myself but in three months \ntime) is modifying or debugging it and doesn\'t have to go through the \nhassle of dealing with the impact of the GOTO.\n\nDave\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users\' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: [ILUG] slashdot EW Dijkstra humor'}
