It is not ready \r\nfor simple usage yet.\r\nI have spent some days fiddling with that stuff based on my own experience and \r\nfeedback i got from users at sidux.\r\nThe best way i found to have a usable index is:\r\n - stop nepomuk and strigi in systemsettings\r\n - move away or delete everything in: \r\n~/.kde/share/apps/nepomuk/repository/main/data/virtuosobackend\r\n(there might be incompatible database from virtuoso 5.x in there)\r\n - out and back in to your account\r\n - start nepomuk andv strigi\r\n - let it do the indexing\r\n - test (in dolphin, krunner is unreliable atm) your index\r\n - see if e.g. files under kmail got indexed\r\n\r\nfor me to have a complete index i had to do 5 runs of strigi.\r\nin the first 3 runs it would not even touch any dot files under .kde\r\nin the end it works fine now but popular searches use a lot of ram.\r\n\r\nregards\r\nFerdinand\r\n\r\n-- \r\nFerdi Thommes\r\nVorstand sidux e.V.\r\nFellow of FSFE\r\nLinuxTag e.V.\r\n____________________________________________________________\r\nwe are sidux - resistance is futile - you will be assimilated :)\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-kde-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
