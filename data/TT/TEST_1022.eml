Ext4 didn\'t, but it\'s=\r\n=20\r\npossible that has been / will be put back.  XFS uses longer gaps between di=\r\nsk=20\r\nsyncs by default, but it is tunable.\r\n\r\nYou could always use the "sync" file system option to avoid the whole issue=\r\n=2E =20\r\nIf that\'s no good enough, a simple shell script (while sleep 5; do sync; do=\r\nne)=20\r\nrunning as root (perhaps started from init) will fill basically the same ro=\r\nle.\r\n\r\nBoth XFS and Ext3/4 recover through journal replay, and it is usually enoug=\r\nh. =20\r\nRarely, a manual filesystem check will be required, and xfs_check is usuall=\r\ny=20\r\nmuch faster than fsck.ext3 or even fsck.ext4.\r\n=2D-=20\r\nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr.           \t ,=3D ,-_-. =3D.\r\nbss@iguanasuicide.net            \t((_/)o o(\\_))\r\nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy \t `-\'(. .)`-\'\r\nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/        \t     \\_/\r\n', 'subject': 'Re: Filesystem recommendations'}
