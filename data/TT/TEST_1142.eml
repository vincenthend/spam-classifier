I\'ve never printed during a power outage but I\r\ncould if I really needed to.  The odds of that are terribly low though.\r\n\r\nThem main reason for plugging all my equipment into the UPS is that the MOVs\r\nin UPSes are usually much larger and of better quality than those found in\r\nsurge protector power strips.  For those who do not know, an MOV or metal\r\noxide varistor, is the device that sucks up the excess voltage and current\r\nthat frequently enters lines during a lighting strike.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nStan\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
