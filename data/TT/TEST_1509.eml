{'body': "Regarding:\nAnother problem I have is that I cannot install my ISDN, USB modem ( LASAT Speed Basic ), however im pretty sure its not supported by Linux, but again it is featured in the Hardware Browser, without installed drivers.\n\nThanks for your replies.... However i still cant get it to detect the External USB modem. I also have an internal 56k fax modem, but i cannot get that detected either ( maybe its because it was designed for Windows and is not supported ). Im not going to buy a new modem ( I think 2 is more than enough for 1 PC ).\n\nIt could well be my inexperience with Linux that is making this more difficult, but whatever it is iv just about had enough!! Any last gasp ideas would be welcome\n\nMany Thanks\n\nMark\n\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n", 'subject': '[ILUG] RE: Newbie Question'}
