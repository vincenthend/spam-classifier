If you want to start graphical applications, put the\r\nappropriate .desktop files in ~/.config/autostart, or use the GNOME\r\nsession manager for the purpose. As others have pointed out, the file\r\n.xsession should be reserved for starting an X session.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nLiam O\'Toole\r\nBirmingham, United Kingdom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
