{'body': '\nOur preschoolers (2 and 4) use Winamp with a Pokemon skin.  It\'s the\n2-yr-old who figured out he could put it into a sidebar menu so all\nhe need do is click there to launch their favourite MP3 playlist.\n\nWhat /we/ need is a good "barely literate" email program.  Years ago\nthe university of Hawaii had a word processor that included a\nvoice-assist and also would pop up menus for common completions as\nwords were typed; even further back there was a DOS shareware editor\nthat did that latter function extremely well (targetted at the\nhandicapped).  With just those little bits of assists, maybe some\nclever use of pictograms too, I bet kindergarten kids could handle\nemail.\n\n-- \nGary Lawrence Murphy <garym@teledyn.com> TeleDynamics Communications Inc\n Business Advantage through Community Software : http://www.teledyn.com\n"Computers are useless.
