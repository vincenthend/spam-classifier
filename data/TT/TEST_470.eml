"Insecure dependency" screams "I\'m in taint mode!", which\nis a typical problem when procmail is setuid/setgid (the permissions\nshould be 755).\n\nIf this is in fact the problem, an easy solution is to put "DROPPRIVS=yes"\nin the procmailrc. :)\n\n--\nRandomly Generated Tagline:\n"The bus had no heat, blew over in the wind and used the driver\'s legs\n as its first line of defense in an accident." - Unknown about the VW Bus\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old\ncell phone?
