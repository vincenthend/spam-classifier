{'body': 'I edited /etc/resolv.conf to add a nameserver, edited /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf \r\nto do the same and added the dns to wicd.  However, I keep getting the same \r\nold dns from the router, i.e., resolv.conf keeps changing to the router\'s 192 \r\nip.  The router does not allow editing dns.  I think this is due to using \r\ndhcp.  Is there an alternative which wouldn\'t cause a default to the router\'s \r\ndns?  Any pointers appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe". Trouble?
