It may be out of date, now, but if I had to guess, the \r\nlevel of threat has only grown.)\r\n\r\nIt depends on the mechanism used to share the folders.  If if is through \r\na network interface, then the risks are similar to the risks on any \r\ntrusted intranet.\r\n\r\nIf the folders are provided by the VM internals, then the risk is what \r\nyou can lose by a successful attack on the guest kernel or the host VM. \r\n  If the host VM is kernel-based, then the risk is that of a (host) \r\nkernel attack.\r\n\r\nNote: I\'m using "risk" as in "what can you lose?"  If you mean attack \r\nvectors, then those should be evident; again, I am not a security \r\nreseacher.  Google Joanna Rutkowska.  She probably knows as much as \r\nanyone about breaking out of a VM to attack the host.\r\n\r\nI\'m sure others on this list know more than I do about it.\r\n\r\nMAA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
