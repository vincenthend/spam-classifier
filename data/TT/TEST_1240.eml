(Sorry\r\nto be vague, I\'m not keen to risk undoing my present success\r\nto double-check. :-)\r\n\r\nVista reported that the OS would need to be rebooted\r\nfor the settings to take effect.\r\n\r\nWhen I rebooted into Linux, I discovered that the\r\nfan would speed up at temperatures of 80C.\r\nAlso, playing video no longer causes overheat\r\nand shutdown.\r\n\r\nIdle temperatures are way down in a reasonable range,\r\naround 60C.\r\n\r\nThe laptop uses Insyde H2O BIOS, which provides\r\nno facilities for setting power-related parameters.\r\nFan controls and other functions are reportedly \r\navailable via the omnibook module. I have yet to test\r\nthis, and no immediate need, having dealt with the\r\nbiggest thorn.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n-- \r\nJoel Roth\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
