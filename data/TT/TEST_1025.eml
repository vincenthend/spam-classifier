There are some known issues with the parsing (such as the \nHTML parsing stuff which is much improved in 2.40 which we're soon to \nrelease), but nothing that's too likely to be fixed by 2.40. Perhaps in \n2.50 though.\n\nMatt.\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nSpamassassin-talk mailing list\nSpamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk\n\n", 'subject': 'Re: [SAtalk] SA very slow (hangs?) on this message, or is it just me?'}
