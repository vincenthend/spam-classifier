What is the brand of\r\nyour enclosure. I want to look for it, in particular, and see if it claims\r\nthe feature that you have discovered. Actually, on looking a little more\r\nclosely, I\'m not seeing any case of a single enclosure that can be used\r\nwith both ATA and SATA. Do I read your post correctly - your enclosure can\r\ncontain either a SATA or an ATA, and work over USB? But SMART only works\r\nwhen it is enclosing an ATA? \r\n\r\n-- \r\nPaul E Condon           \r\npecondon@mesanetworks.net\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
