{'body': 'I\'ll always be slowly catching up on comp tech. \r\n\r\nI was using Knoppix and ClamAV to remove a virus for a friend when the\r\nfutility of it all hit me.  The free anti-virus hopscotch game that windows\r\nusers play to feel safe.  What wasted energy--over an OS I boot into maybe\r\n7% of the time.  They screw up half the time.\r\n\r\nThere isn\'t a big demand for ClamAV on the Debian partitions of a\r\nlaptop/desktop.  But I\'ll be scheduling scans of the XP partition from\r\nDebian.  Doh!\r\n\r\nThere is even a ClamAV *win32* for the unlucky.\r\n \r\n-- \r\nKind Regards,\r\nFreeman\r\n\r\nhttp://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
