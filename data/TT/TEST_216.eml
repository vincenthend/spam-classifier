{'body': 'Hi,\r\n\r\nI am running up-to-date squeeze on a Dell Latitude D420. I have a\r\ntrivial problem, but such things bother me :-)\r\n\r\nThe hotkeys for volume and brightness adjustment work out of the box in a\r\nGNOME session. However, when I adjust the volume using the hotkeys, I see\r\na nice translucent on-screen display of the volume level. This is not\r\nthe case for brightness control.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, I briefly installed KDE a couple of days ago. I then\r\nfound that, *during a GNOME session*, the brightness OSD did appear. It\r\nvanished again after I removed KDE.\r\n\r\nSo, the KDE installation seemed to pull in some package which is\r\nresponsible for the brightness OSD. Any idea which of the dozens of\r\npackages it might be?\r\n\r\nLiam\r\n\r\n-- \r\nLiam O\'Toole\r\nBirmingham, United Kingdom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
