We\nsimply can\'t continue down the path where every\nscript kiddie with a grudge or political agenda can\ncause millions or billions of dollars worth of\ndamage.\n\n(2) Very likely, email practices will evolve to the\npoint that digital signatures are the standard way\nto recognize the sender of a message. Sabotaging\nyour machine or otherwise compromising your private\nkey will be the only way that someone can forge a\nmessage from you. I don\'t see any reason that email\nsoftware that automatically uses digital signatures\nfor contact management and whitelisting would be\nany more expensive than existing email clients.\nUnless Microsoft manages to get a defacto monopoly\non it.\n\n(3) I think identity theft should be made a felony,\nwith very stiff penalties, for reasons that have\nnothing to do with spam. No, obviously, simply\nparading around with a sign that says "I\'m George\nBush" is not identity theft. On the other hand,\nI think using a virus to compromise someone else\'s\nprivate key should should fall into that category.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: \nhttp://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: Forged whitelist spam'}
