{'body': 'Hello List,\r\n\r\nI like my audible bell very much. I really really like it =E2=80=93\r\nunfortunately, Metacity (from current Testing) blocks it in the\r\nfollowing way:\r\n\r\n* "beep" works fine\r\n* "xkbbell -force" works, but it doesn\'t w/o the "-force"\r\n* Gnome-Terminal and all the other applications can only bell\r\n  "visible", i. e. I get a flash when enabling the visible bell in\r\n  Metacity\'s gconf-preferences but no audible bell if I disable it\r\n  (and leave "audible bell" enabled).\r\n* The module pcspkr is compiled into the kernel and works fine, as\r\n  proven above.\r\n* The volume of the "Bell"-output is at 50% in Alsamixer, and as\r\n  proven above, ok this way.\r\n\r\nI assume this is the same bug as described in\r\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/metacity/+bug/486154/\r\n\r\nand comment 50 seems to provide a solution I didn\'t test yet =E2=80=93 my\r\nquestion is, wether or not there is a Debian-way to enable the bell\r\nin Metacity or if I have to switch window managers as Piotr Engelking\r\ndid here: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=3D551590\r\n\r\nThe hints he gave in this bug report unfortunately don\'t work for me\r\n=E2=80=93 I enabled the corresponding keys, but still can\'t hear a bell,\r\nprobably because I don\'t use ESD (is there any reason why I should\r\ninstall this? ALSA works just fine for me=E2=80=A6)\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nClaudius\r\n\r\nii  metacity \t1:2.28.0-3\tlightweight GTK+ window manager\r\nii  gnome-core\t1:2.28+7\tThe GNOME Desktop Environment -- ess=E2=80=A6\r\n\r\n--=20\r\nHome on the Range was originally written in beef-flat.\r\n\r\nhttp://chubig.net/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
