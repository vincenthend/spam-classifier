He offended conservatives and the\n# politically correct left with his 1998 novel "Les Particules\n# Elementaires" ("Atomised" in English).\n#\n# Paris Mosque rector Dalil Boubakeur says Muslims have been insulted\n# once before by Houellebecq, who had the main character in Plateforme\n# admit he felt "a quiver of glee" every time a "Palestinian\n# terrorist" was killed.\n#\n# The World Islamic League, the Lyon Mosque and the National\n# Federation of Muslims in France have joined the Paris Mosque in\n# bringing Houellebecq to trial.\n#\n# France\'s Human Rights League joined them as a civil party, saying\n# Houellebecq\'s comments amounted to "Islamophobia" and deserved to be\n# sanctioned as part of the league\'s struggle against discrimination\n# and racism.\n#\n# The Paris Mosque has hired Jean-Marc Varaut, one of France\'s leading\n# trial lawyers, whose past clients include Maurice Papon, the former\n# official condemned in 1998 for Nazi-era crimes against humanity for\n# sending Jews to death camps.\n#\n# RESTORING BLASPHEMY?\n#\n# Houellebecq\'s lawyer Emmanuel Pierrat argues that the case\n# effectively re-establishes the notion of blasphemy, despite the fact\n# that France as a secular state has no such law, and says\n# Houellebecq\'s opponents want to deny him freedom of expression.\n#\n# He also argues that the interview in Lire truncated a six-hour\n# conversation and Houellebecq was not given the chance to approve the\n# article before it appeared.\n#\n# Houellebecq\'s publisher Flammarion has distanced itself from the\n# author, whose comments some say may have cost him France\'s\n# prestigious Goncourt prize -- for which he had been a contender.\n#\n# The novelist, who lives outside Cork, Ireland, writes in a detached\n# style about a bleak world in which people have forgotten how to\n# love.\n#\n# Translated into 25 languages, "Atomised" incensed France\'s 1968\n# generation with its scathing descriptions of the hippie era but won\n# him France\'s November prize in 1998 and the Impac award, one of the\n# world\'s biggest fiction prizes.\n#\n# Losing his case may mean a year in jail or a $51,000 fine.\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n', 'subject': "Defending Unliked Speech Re: Hanson's Sept 11 message in the\n    National Review"}
