Well maybe KMail does address completion more directly than=\r\n=20\r\nvia KAddressBook. There might be a component in KDEPIM libs doing that for=\r\n=20\r\nKMail. For - just for looking up email address - KMail really calls into=20\r\nAkonadi.\r\n\r\nBut AFAIK it doesn\'t use Akonadi - through what ways ever - for anything=20\r\nother than retrieving contact data. Thus the use of Akonadi could not be=20\r\nthat wide-spread in KMail.\r\n\r\nHowever, KDEPIM will use Akonadi more and more, so IMHO its better to have=\r\n=20\r\nAkonadi improved and fixed than to remove the Akonadi dependency in KMail=20\r\ntemporarily.\r\n\r\n=2D-=20\r\nMartin \'Helios\' Steigerwald - http://www.Lichtvoll.de\r\nGPG: 03B0 0D6C 0040 0710 4AFA  B82F 991B EAAC A599 84C7\r\n', 'subject': 'Re: KDE 4.4.3 in unstable'}
