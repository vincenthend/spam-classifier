So becomming a university professor was your second career \nchoice?  ;-)\n\nSeriously though (or not, as the case may be), The Amazing Spiderman had \nmany other abilities to help him out. Most notable, perhaps, was his \n'spidey strength' and 'spidey senses'. The strength to weight ratio of a \nspider is so high that Spiderman is able to throw a bus several city \nblocks with little effort. His endurance is similarly enhanced as well.\n\nAs for the spidey senses, well they're really great, but AFAIK not \nreally well explained in the comic series. Spiders have multiple eyes, \nears, noses and tongues which Peter Parker did not visibly have. There \nhave been a few attempts to explain his heightened reflexes, from the \nbiological to hidden methamphetamine use, but none seem to do the spidey \nsense justice... I seem to recall Spiderman being able to detect the \npresence of well concealed weapons and even sense evil-doers while they \nwere in their street clothes. Perhaps the spidey senses are the result \nof some sort of quantum entanglement?\n\n\nElias\n\n\n", 'subject': 'Re: Gecko adhesion finally sussed.'}
