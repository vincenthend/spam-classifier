{'body': '\n\nformail did the trick. Thanks to those who answered. For the sake of\narchives, here\'s how to "patch" ricochet:\n\n\n1. procmailrc (/tmp/pmrc):\n\nRICOCHET=/usr/local/etc/ricochet\nPMDIR=/tmp\nLOGFILE=$PMDIR/pmlog\nVERBOSE=yes\nMAILDIR=/tmp\nLOGABSTRACT=all\n\n:0 f\n| /usr/local/bin/ri2\n\n\n2. /usr/local/bin/ri2 (to test):\n\n#!/bin/sh\n/usr/local/bin/ricochet -DONT_SEND >/tmp/rico.$$\n\n3. formmail exec:\n\nformail -ds procmail /tmp/pmrc </tmp/spm\n\n-end-\n\nSorry for such brief instructions. The only problem here is that I get\nanother copy of the spam in the spambox again. This can be fixed with some\nprocmailrc tweaking (the ":0 f" part).\n\nCheers,\n-zeek\n\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: razor-users-admin@example.sourceforge.net\n> [mailto:razor-users-admin@lists.sourceforge.net]On Behalf Of Sven\n> Willenberger\n> Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2002 4:06 PM\n> To: zeek@sparklehouse.com\n> Cc: razor-users@example.sourceforge.net\n> Subject: Re: [Razor-users] Ricochet Question Actually\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> ----- Original Message -----\n> > From: "zeek" <zeek@sparklehouse.com>\n> > To: <razor-users@example.sourceforge.net>\n> > Date: Tue, 13 Aug 2002 12:07:10 -0400\n> > Subject: [Razor-users] Ricochet Question Actually\n> >\n> >\n> > Greetings,\n> >\n> > I\'ve not been able to find a list regarding ricochet (closely related to\n> > razor: http://www.vipul.net/ricochet/) so I\'m posting here.\n> >\n> > Every few days I manually go through a spam harvest that Spamassassin\n> > collects (by way of checking against osirosoft, razor, et.\n> al.).
