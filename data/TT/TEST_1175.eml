{'body': '(Via Robot Wisdom)   Maybe you UC folk know these people?\n\nhttp://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2002-08/lcc-sph082202.php\n\nWorking at Lewis & Clark College, the University of California at Berkeley, \nthe University of California at Santa Barbara, and Stanford University, \nthe interdisciplinary team:\n\n    * confirmed speculation that the gecko\'s amazing climbing ability \ndepends on weak molecular attractive forces called van der Waals forces,\n\n    * rejected a competing model based on the adhesion chemistry of water \nmolecules, and\n\n* discovered that the gecko\'s adhesive depends on geometry, not surface \nchemistry. In other words, the size and shape of the tips of gecko foot \nhairs--not what they are made of--determine the gecko\'s stickiness.\n\nTo verify its experimental and theoretical results, the gecko group then \nused its new data to fabricate prototype synthetic foot-hair tips from two \ndifferent materials.\n\n"Both artificial setal tips stuck as predicted," notes Autumn, assistant \nprofessor of biology at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Ore. "Our \ninitial prototypes open the door to manufacturing the first biologically \ninspired dry, adhesive microstructures, which can have widespread \napplications." \n\n', 'subject': 'Gecko adhesion finally sussed.'}
