I inherited the dos part of it and worked mostly on\ncreating the other end of it. Near the end of the project we gave it\nextensive long burnin tests, sadly overnight tests would always crash\nout for some obscure reason.  Tracking it down showed that my\npredecessor\'s "add new entries to the end of its linked list" function\nrecursively called itself with each following link until the terminating\none showed up. Of course it died miserably when it ran out of stack. I\'m\nsure he felt he\'d done a good days work when he planted that bomb for\nme.\n\nC.\n-- \nCaolan McNamara               |  caolan@skynet.ie  \nhttp://www.skynet.ie/~caolan  |  +353 86 8161184\nSo much insanity, so little time...\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users\' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: [ILUG] slashdot EW Dijkstra humor'}
