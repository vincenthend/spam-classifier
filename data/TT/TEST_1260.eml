Now, I want to use my position in the bank to transfer this \r\nmoney to your country for investment.If you can provide me with an \r\naccount where I can transfer this (twenty five million five hundred \r\nthousand pounds) I will give you 40% of this entire fund while the \r\nremaining 50% shall be for me, extra 10% will be for transfer charges. \r\nI am hoping to get a favourable response from you. \r\nMR.
