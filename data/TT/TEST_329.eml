At a recent function honoring America\'s\nwar widows, Bush sported a visible erection when his speech turned to\nthe subject of the Middle East.\n\n\'Believe me when I say this. With or without the help of other\nnations, with or without UN approval, we will penetrate Iraq\'s\nborders. With overwhelming force, we will pound Iraq over and over\nagain without ceasing. And, once its leaders concede defeat, we will\nseed Iraq with American-style democracy.\'\n\nAides say the podium was scrubbed down thoroughly after the event with\na special cleanser/biocide not used since the Clinton\nadministration.".....\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
