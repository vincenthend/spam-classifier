{'body': '\nSome interesting quotes...\n\nhttp://www.postfun.com/pfp/worbois.html\n\n\nThomas Jefferson:\n\n"I have examined all the known superstitions of the word, and I do not\nfind in our particular superstition of Christianity one redeeming feature.\nThey are all alike founded on fables and mythology. Millions of innocent\nmen, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been\nburnt, tortured, fined and imprisoned. What has been the effect of this\ncoercion? To make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites;\nto support roguery and error all over the earth."\n\nSIX HISTORIC AMERICANS,\nby John E. Remsburg, letter to William Short\nJefferson again:\n\n"Christianity...(has become) the most perverted system that ever shone on\nman. ...Rogueries, absurdities and untruths were perpetrated upon the\nteachings of Jesus by a large band of dupes and importers led by Paul, the\nfirst great corrupter of the teaching of Jesus."\n\n\n', 'subject': '[vox] Founding Fathers on Religion'}
