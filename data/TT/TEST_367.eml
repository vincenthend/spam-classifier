Somehow\r\nplasma-desktop was uninstalled during the process :(\r\n\r\nI was able to set the TV on the right of my monitor with proper\r\nresolution. I haven\'t checked yet if this settings stay after I relogin\r\nor not (should have been in bed half an hour ago). One thin which still\r\nhappens is that the KDE panel goes to the TV screen (HDMI signal). How\r\ncan I set it to stay on the LCD monitor?\r\n\r\nOne more quirk: even with the TV screen disabled, the mouse is able to\r\ntravel beyond the right edge of the LCD monitor display!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKS\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
