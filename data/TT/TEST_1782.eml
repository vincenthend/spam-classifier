{'body': 'From nobody Fri Sep  7 01:05:24 2018\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\n\nHi,\r\n\r\nWhen compiling any .tex document using the route latex -> dvips ->\r\nps2pdf, I get a PDF. Normal, but the problem is that if I the PDF is\r\nalready opened (e.g. because I was reading the version of the document\r\nbefore having modified and compiled it) when the compilation and the\r\nwhole process ends, the opened PDF is blank, i.e. the current page\r\nbecomes white, and every page I go at is white. If I then re-open the\r\ndocument, I find the new version of my PDF.\r\n\r\nI would like to know how this process actually works. For me, it looks\r\nlike the ps2pdf tool creates the PDF from scratch, and overwrites the\r\nold PDF. But why am I receiving no warning message from acroread?\r\nAnyway, acroread seems not to be locking the file, or, if so, ps2pdf\r\nforces the writing.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n--=20\r\nMerciadri Luca\r\nSee http://www.student.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/~merciadri/\r\nI use PGP.
