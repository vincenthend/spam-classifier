That wasn\'t my\r\nintention at all.  I was speaking figuratively, not literally.  My point was\r\nthat swapping out the production switch, which probably has others users\r\nplugged in, shouldn\'t be the first troubleshooting step, especially if it\'s\r\na managed switch and can thus show per port configuration and traffic data.\r\n\r\nThis data usually shines a bight light on these types of issues.  Usually\r\nthe problem in cases like the OP is having relate to VLAN configuration.  On\r\nmanyy/most managed switches which have global VLANs already configured, but\r\nnot all ports configured, if you plug a PC into an unconfigured port the PC\r\nsees a dead network.  The solution is to add that port to one or more\r\nappropriate VLANs.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nStan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
