Also, I have read that a\r\ncommon rating of drive failure is an unrecoverable read rate of 1\r\nbit in 10^14 - that is 1 bit in every 10TB. While doing a rebuild\r\nacross 4 or 5 drives that would mean it is likely to hit an\r\nunrecoverable read. With RAID 5 (no redundancy during rebuild due to\r\nfailed drive) that would be game over. Is this correct?\r\n\r\nTim.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe". Trouble?
