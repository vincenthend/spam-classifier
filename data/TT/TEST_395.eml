{'body': "Dear Friend,\r\n\r\nAs you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for\r\nme, because, I believe everyone will die someday.\r\nMy name is MR Wahid Adada a Crude Oil merchant in IRAN,i\r\nhave been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .\r\nIt has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and\r\nright now I have only about a few months to live,\r\naccording to medical experts.\r\nI have not particularly lived my life so well, as I\r\nnever really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my\r\nbusiness. Though I am very rich, I was never\r\ngenerous, I was always hostile to people and only\r\nfocused on my business as that was the only thing I\r\ncared for. But now I regret all this as I now know\r\nthat there is more to life than just wanting to have\r\nor make all the money in the world.\r\nI believe when God gives me a second chance to come\r\nto this world I would live my life a different way\r\nfrom how I have lived it. Now that God has called\r\nme, I have willed and given most of my property\r\nand assets to my immediate and extended family\r\nmembers as well as a few close friends.\r\nI want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul\r\nso, I have decided to give alms to charity\r\norganizations, as I want this to be one of the last\r\ngood deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed\r\nmoney to some charity organizations in Austra, cameroun,\r\nliberia,Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has\r\ndeteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself\r\nanymore. I once asked members of my family to close\r\none of my accounts and distribute the money which I have\r\nthere to charity organization in Bulgaria and\r\nPakistan, they refused and kept the money to\r\nthemselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as\r\nthey seem not to be contended with what I have left\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nThe last of my money which no one knows of is the\r\nhuge cash deposit of fifteen million dollars\r\n$15,000,000,00 that I have with a finance/Security\r\nCompany abroad. I will want you to help me collect this\r\ndeposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have set aside 10% for you and for your time.\r\n\r\nGod be with you.\r\n\r\nMR Wahid Adada\r\n\r\n\r\n", 'subject': '[spam] [SPAM]  Charity Money'}
