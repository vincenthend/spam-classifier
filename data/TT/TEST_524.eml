{'body': 'I need to play two movies in sync, compositing them in a custom way. \r\nOne approach I came up with is to put the movies in QTMovieLayers (Core \r\nAnimation), and then I can use a Core Image filter for the compositing. \r\n  Does that sound reasonable, or is there another approach that is \r\nlikely to perform significantly better?\r\n-- \r\n   James W.
