I told a friend I wanted a server distro that\r\nwasn\'t going to spoon feed me, but make me learn something about Linux.\r\n\r\nCasey, a seasoned Debian sysadmin, recommended I download the Debian net\r\ninstall floppies and do my first install from the mirrors, only a compact\r\nbase install, and to install everything else I needed by hand with apt.\r\nThat was Potato with a 2.2 kernel.\r\n\r\nI only use Linux for non-GUI servers.  I don\'t use desktop Linux.  All my\r\nadmin\'ing requires knuckle busting. ;)  And I like it that way.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nStan\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
