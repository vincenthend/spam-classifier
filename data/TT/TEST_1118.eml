I've seen the *opposite* issue - if I go to *SEND* a signed message,\nsometimes Exmh will put up the dialog box, but fail to set keyboard focus\nthere, so no passphrase can be entered.  Of course, hitting 'return' doesnt\nwork so you need to click the 'OK' box, at which point it finds that the\npassphrase that wasn't entered doesn't work, and asks again, this time with\nproper focus set.\n\nI suspect some variable/codepath is getting hosed for the focus, or possibly\nsome borkedness with --no-tty and/or --status-fd flags to gnupg.\n\n/Valdis\n", 'subject': 'Re: exmh bug?'}
