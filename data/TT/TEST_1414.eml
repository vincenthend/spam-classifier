Then do random.shuffle() on an os.listdir() of that directory.\nThen it's trivial to split the result into N slices, and move the files into\nN other directories accordingly.\n\n> I suspect you can pull the same stunt for your Data/Spam stuff.\n\nYup!\n\n", 'subject': '[Spambayes] Current histograms'}
