But then again so is French. I did 3 years\nof French in primary school and 6 in secondary school. So, that\'s 9 years of\nFrench. Which, I guess, should be long enough to be fluent in most languages.\nAs it turns out, my French is crap. My Irish is much better. \n\nThe problem seems to be the braindead attempt to make people learn languages\nthey can\'t speak through reading and writing. And then tacking on speech as\nan afterthought. Whereas doing it the other way round would be a lot more\nuseful...\n\nI hear this complaint a lot, but I never hear people complaining about being\n"forced" to learn to read and write, or to do maths. Maybe people don\'t mind\nas much if it is perceived as a useful skill (which Irish is not usually\nperceived as).\n\nAnyway, tir gan teanga tir gan anam :)\n\nNick\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users\' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n', 'subject': '[OT] Irish language (was Re: [ILUG] Fwd: Linux Beer Hike)'}
