{'body': "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have a web-service that produces static images from various sources =\r\nusing Quartz.\r\n\r\nRecently I wanted to add the capability of adding QTMovie screenshots =\r\nthere, but I'm having some issues.\r\n\r\nWhen the service is run by a user which currently has a graphical login, =\r\nit works fine - I can load a QTMovie, and grab a frame from a specific =\r\ntime to be used in the image export.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, in the production environment, the app is run by a user which =\r\nis not logged in. Everything else (Quartz) works fine, but QTMovie =\r\nloading bails out with this:\r\n\r\n=\r\n/SourceCache/QTOtherComponents/QuickTime-1674/MidVale/AVA_VP3_QT/Component=\r\n/AVA_HDUtilitiesHW.c: CGGetOnlineDisplayList failed with code 1011=20\r\n=\r\n/SourceCache/QTOtherComponents/QuickTime-1674/MidVale/AVA_VP3_QT/Component=\r\n/AVA_HDUtilitiesHW.c: CGGetOnlineDisplayList failed with code 1011=20\r\n_RegisterApplication(), FAILED TO establish the default connection to =\r\nthe WindowServer, _CGSDefaultConnection() is NULL\r\n=\r\n/SourceCache/QTOtherComponents/QuickTime-1674/MidVale/AVA_VP3_QT/Component=\r\n/AVA_HDUtilitiesHW.c: CGGetOnlineDisplayList failed with code 1011=20\r\n\r\nIs there a way to work around this? I only want to get the poster image =\r\nfrom that movie, nothing else. I can detect in my code when I'm not =\r\nconnected to the windowserver with CGGetOnlineDisplayList, so I can =\r\nswitch to a different code path if required.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nOrestis Markou=\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
