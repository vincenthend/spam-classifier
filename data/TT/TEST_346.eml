{'body': '\nI wanted to get back to this but didn\'t have the time.  I actually lived on\na couple different Indian reservations growing up in the Pacific Northwest\nand also spent a fair amount time in Lakota/Sioux country as well.  And my\nparents have lived on an even more diverse range of Indian reservations than\nI have (my experience being a direct result of living with my parents).  I\ndo get a lot of my information first-hand, or in some cases, second-hand\nfrom my father.\n\nThe income figures for the Indians are somewhat misleading, mostly because\nit is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income.  While it\nis true that some Indians live in genuine poverty, it is typically as a\nconsequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe, not\nsomething that was impressed upon them.\n\nThe primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity\nthat exists separately from the individuals, typically an "Indian\nCorporation" of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a\nsingle share (the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from\ntribe to tribe).  In most tribes, a dividend is paid out to each of the\ntribal members from the corporation, usually to the tune of $10-30k per\nperson, depending on the tribe.  The dividend money comes from a number of\nplaces, with the primary sources being the Federal Gov\'t and various\nbusinesses/assets owned by the Indian corporation.\n\nYou have to understand a couple things:  First, a great many Indian tribes\nare run as purely communist enterprises.  Everyone gets a check for their\nshare no matter what.  One of the biggest problems this has caused is very\nhigh unemployment (often 70-90%) for tribal members, who are more than happy\ntake their dividend and not work.  The dividend they receive from the\ncorporation often constitutes their sole "income" for government accounting\npurposes.  Unfortunately, to support this type of economics when no one\nworks, they\'ve had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain those\ndividends.  Many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so because\nthey have run out of things to sell yet nobody works.  One of the ironies is\nthat on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn,\nmany of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor white\nfolk, not Indians.\n\nSecond, even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend, they also\nreceive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the Indian corporation\nto the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually.  By\nbenefits and perks, we are talking about the kinds of things no other\nordinary American receives from either their employer or the government.\n\nIt should be pointed out that while many of these Indian corporations are\nineptly run, and mostly provide sinecures for other Indians, a minority are\nvery smartly managed and a few hire non-Indian business executives with good\ncredentials to run their business divisions.  An example of this is the\nHaida Corporation, which while having less 1,000 tribal shareholders, has\nbillions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own have\ngross revenues in the $200-300 million range (and growing).  Yet the\ndividend paid out is strictly controlled, about $20k in this particular\ncase, and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades before\ndrawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led to\nintelligent investment and use.  They don\'t eat their seed corn, and have\nactually managed to grow their stash.  In contrast, a couple islands over,\nthere is another tribe of ~2,000 people that has a net loss of about $50\nmillion annually IIRC while being regularly endowed by the Federal\ngovernment with several billions of dollars in valuable assets.  This\nparticular tribe has a modest income in theory, but the actual expenditures\nper person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many\nborrow money against future income.  Incidentally, in this particular case,\nthe people that ARE working frequently pull in a few hundred thousand\ndollars a year, much of which goes back to the tribal corporation rather\nthan their own pockets.\n\nSomewhat annoying, the Federal government semi-regularly grants valuable\nassets to these tribes when they\'ve burned through the ones previously given\nwhere feasible, typically selling the assets to American or foreign\ncompanies.  And the cycle continues.\n\nSo what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems?  In a\nnutshell, a thoroughly pathological culture and society.\n\nFew women reach the age of 16 without getting pregnant.  Incest, rape, and\ngross promiscuity is rampant.  Inbreeding, heavy drug abuse during\npregnancy, and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very\nsubstantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded.  Many of\nthe thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the\nearliest opportunity, mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above.  On one\nreservation my parents lived, the HIV infection rate was >70%.  Many of\nthese societies are thoroughly corrupt, and the administration of the law is\narbitrary and capricious (they do have their own judges, courts, police\netc).\n\nIn short, many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a\nshambles because they have become THE most pathological societies that I\nhave ever seen anywhere.  Because of their legal status, there really aren\'t\nthat many consequences for their behavior.  There are many things that I\ncould tell you that I\'ve seen that you probably would not believe unless\nyou\'d seen it yourself.  There are always good people in these tribes, but\nit has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good\nguys by a fair margin many times, and this IS a mobocracy typically.  (BTW,\nif any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as\na minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are\nopenly thugs, try living on one of these messed up Indian reservations.  It\nwill give you an interesting perspective on things.)\n\nThere are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous\nIndians.  The first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and\nintelligent people that have managed their assets wisely.  The second is\nwhere the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part, even if\nthey maintain their tribal identity.  In both of these cases, the tribal\nleaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological\ncases mentioned above.\n\nThe Indians are often quite wealthy technically, and a lot of money is spent\nby the tribe per capita.  And the actual reportable income is quite high\nwhen you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole.  It is\njust that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to\nordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income.  The\npoverty is social and cultural in nature, not economic.  This was my\noriginal point.\n\n\nOn a tangent:\n\nOne thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi-tribal\ncorporate socialism.  Many Indian tribes implement a type of corporate\nsocialism that is mind-bogglingly bad in execution.  That they use this\nstructure at all is an accident of history more than anything.  But what has\ninterested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly well\nover the long run.  It is like a Family Corporation writ large.\n\nIt seems that in a future where "familial" ties will be increasingly\nvoluntary, the general concept may have some merit in general Western\nsociety, serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family with\nthe included dynamics, but with an arbitrary set of self-selecting\nindividuals.\n\nDamn that was long (and its late), and it could have been a lot longer.\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com \n\n\n\nOn 9/22/02 3:53 PM, "John Hall" <johnhall@evergo.net> wrote:\n> \n> As I understand it, there is a huge difference between native Americans\n> who speak english at home and those who do not.
