Recently Dan Brian improved on that with a little bit\nof natural language processing. Now [1]The Perl Review makes pretty\npictures of it all. Based on searches of AltaVista and Google, we found\nthat not a lot of people think PHP or Lisp sucks, a lot think C++ and\nJava suck, and they put Perl is somewhere in the middle. Does Perl suck\nmore than it use to suck, or has PHP just shot way ahead?"\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=02/09/17/189201\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://www.theperlreview.com\n    1. http://www.theperlreview.com/at_a_glance.html\n\n\n\nCopyright 1997-2002 pudge.
