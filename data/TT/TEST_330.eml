But be sure to add the optional flag to the LinuxOld\r\nsection in /etc/lilo.conf.  Without it, lilo will generate an error if\r\nthere are not at least two kernels installed.\r\n> \r\n> Any chance of you posting the customization instructions on \r\n> your Web site?\r\n\r\nWell, I already have, sort of.  The trouble is that it\'s buried in a\r\nlarger document on custom kernel building.  People see that and think,\r\n"Oh, I\'m not building a custom kernel; so I don\'t need to read this."\r\nBut Step 10 on my kernel building page\r\n\r\n   http://www.wowway.com/~zlinuxman/Kernel.htm\r\n\r\ntalks about customizing the kernel installation environment, and that\r\npart is applicable to both stock and custom kernels.  The instructions\r\nfor customizing the Lenny environment work for Squeeze also, provided\r\nthat you use *only* stock kernels.  The minute you introduce a custom\r\nkernel, you *must* use the hook scripts, as documented in the Squeeze\r\nsection.\r\n\r\n> Stephen Powell wrote:\r\n>> There is a newer kernel available in squeeze now, 2.6.32-5.\r\n> \r\n> Sid isn\'t it?

If you need\r\ninstructions for how to pull in the Sid kernel without upgrading\r\nyour whole system to Sid, let me know and I can provide that.\r\nAlso, you might try disabling ACPI and try the vesa driver,\r\nas explained in another post.\r\n\r\n-- \r\n  .\'\'`.
