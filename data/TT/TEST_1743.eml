Perhaps Manoj will comment?\r\n\r\nI didn\'t say it wouldn\'t work.  I said it is unsupported.  There\'s\r\na difference.  Debian does make modifications to the kernel source.\r\nThe official Debian kernel source packages have been modified by the\r\nDebian kernel team after downloading them from kernel.org.  There is\r\na reason for all of these modifications.  Often it\'s to prune "non-free"\r\ndrivers from the kernel source tree.  But there may be other modifications\r\nmade for other reasons.  The Debian kernel team only supports their\r\nown kernel sources.  If you obtain kernel source code directly from\r\nupstream, and you have problems running it, you will have to seek\r\nsupport and file bug reports directly with upstream kernel development.\r\nYou can\'t file a bug report against the Debian kernel source package\r\nbecause it\'s not the Debian kernel source.  And you can\'t ask for\r\nhelp from the Debian kernel team on their list because it\'s not\r\ntheir source.  They will have nothing to do with it.  That\'s what\r\nI mean by unsupported.\r\n\r\n-- \r\n  .\'\'`.
