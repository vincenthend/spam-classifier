Excuses vary, from\n"no available copper" to "full DSLAM", but the folks I know who\'ve wanted\nDSL around here have all failed, ending up either with ATTBB, RCN or an\nhonest-to-god T1.\n\n        -j\n> \n> Luis\n> \n\n-- \njesse reed vincent -- root@eruditorum.org -- jesse@fsck.com \n70EBAC90: 2A07 FC22 7DB4 42C1 9D71 0108 41A3 3FB3 70EB AC90\n\nThis is scary.  I\'m imagining tracerouting you and seeing links like "Route\n84" and "Route 9, Exit 14".
