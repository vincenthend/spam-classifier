It\nshould have been 0.  I understand that initially only spammy scores\nwere included.  But I believe the algorithm should be purely\nsymmetrical and non-spammy negative values should also have been\nbalancing out the spammy positive values, like they do in SA today.\nThen anything that was positive would be spam and anything negative\nwould be non-spam.  (And I guess exactly zero is grey. :-) Today's\nchoice of 5 just adds an offset.  Which I think cause people to assume\nthings work differently than they do.\n\nBob\n", 'subject': 'Re: [SAtalk] O.T.
