In the general case, it might be quicker to \r\nenable DHCP than to find out what network the router resets to. Usually \r\n192.168.0. or 192.168.1., but not always.\r\n\r\nIn the days before Internet dongles, the only Net connection available \r\nwas usually the one on the other side of an apparently non-functional \r\nrouter, and the customer had no idea where the book/CD was.\r\n\r\nAnd to be honest, I normally run XP on my laptop, and it\'s just ticking \r\nor unticking a box. Windows has moved on, no reboot necessary... I can \r\nremember needing the installation CD to change IP addresses on 95/98.\r\n-- \r\nJoe\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
