Using this\nto preview your travels, or figure out where you are,\nwould be very valuable.\n\nOnline gaming continues to grow. Screw "Britannia", \nreal-life Britain would be a fun world to wander/\nconquer/explore virtually, in role-playing or real-\ntime-strategy games.\n\nAnd of course, as James Rogers points out, it\'s an\nideal display substrate for all sorts of other \noverlaid data. Maps are great, photrealistic 3-D\nmaps of everywhere which can have many other static \nand dynamic datasets overlaid are spectacular. \n\n(Combining those last two thoughts: consider the\nstatic world map, in faded colors, with patches\nhere-and-there covered by live webcams, stitched\nover the static info in bright colors... it\'d be\nlike the "fog of war" view in games like Warcraft,\nover the real world.)\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n\n\n', 'subject': 'earthviewer apps Re: whoa'}
