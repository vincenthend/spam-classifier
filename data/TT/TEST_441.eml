{'body': 'Hi all,\n\nI\'ve decided at last to test the ALSA sound drivers. As usual the result is\nthat I\'ve spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually\ntesting the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality\npeople seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit from\nthat, right? ;-)\n\nI\'ve got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system, but the packages\nshould easily install or at least recompile on Enigma, Limbo/(null) and\nmaybe others, who knows ;-)\n\nHere are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out :\n- Recompile the "alsa-driver" source rpm for your running kernel\n  (you can install the binary package if you\'re using the i686 2.4.18-10)\n- Install this "alsa-driver" package\n- Install the "alsa-libs" package\n- Install the "alsa-utils" package\n\nNow go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your\n/etc/modules.conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading :\nhttp://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/\n(very complete and very good documentation!)\nHopefully you\'ll see that your card *is* supported ;-)\n\nReboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you\'ll probably need\nto stop many applications to free the sound resource...) "by hand" and\ninsert the new ones. If all is well you\'ve got ALSA working! ("dmesg" to\ncheck is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels with\ne.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default.\n\nWith "aplay" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. You\ncan also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit...\nhmmm, but maybe it\'s another plugin) to listen to your good ol\' mp3\nfiles... that\'s it!\n\nIt really isn\'t complicated, and has never been from what I see. The only\nthing I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can\'t\nimagine myself doing that ;-) I\'ve repackaged everything cleanly. Even the\n/dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly\n%post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.d\nstructure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with the\ndefault provided ALSA spec files, for example I\'ve split alsa-lib\'s\ndevelopment files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included static\nlibraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version against\nwhich the "alsa-driver" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the\nrpm release, so does the architecture!).\n\nI\'m open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!\n\nDownload :\nhttp://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/\n\nCurrent spec files :\nhttp://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-driver/alsa-driver.spec\nhttp://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-lib/alsa-lib.spec\nhttp://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-utils/alsa-utils.spec\n(All others, patches etc. : http://freshrpms.net/builds/ )\n\nMatthias\n\nPS: As an extra bonus, I\'ve also recompiled xine with alsa support! Simply\nrun "xine -A alsa09" and off you go! It may even support 5.1 and S/PDIF ;-)\n\n-- \nClean custom Red Hat Linux rpm packages : http://freshrpms.net/\nRed Hat Linux release 7.3 (Valhalla) running Linux kernel 2.4.18-10\nLoad : 0.57 0.42 0.42, AC on-line, battery charging: 29% (1:55)\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n', 'subject': 'ALSA (almost) made easy'}
