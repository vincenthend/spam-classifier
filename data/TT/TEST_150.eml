{'body': 'This automatic mail gives an overview over security issues that were recently \r\nfixed in Debian Testing. The majority of fixed packages migrate to testing \r\nfrom unstable. If this would take too long, fixed packages are uploaded to the \r\ntesting-security repository instead. It can also happen that vulnerable \r\npackages are removed from Debian testing.\r\n\r\nMigrated from unstable:\r\n=======================\r\ngnu-smalltalk 3.1-6:\r\nCVE-2009-3736: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3736\r\n               http://bugs.debian.org/559809\r\n\r\nRemoved from testing:\r\n=====================\r\nThe following issues have been "fixed" by removing the (source) packages from \r\ntesting. This probably means that you have to manually uninstall the \r\ncorresponding binary packages to fix the issues.\r\nIt can also mean that the packages have been replaced, or that they have been \r\ntemporarily removed by the release team to make transitions from unstable \r\neasier.\r\n\r\nwebcalendar:\r\nCVE-2010-0636: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-0636\r\nCVE-2010-0637: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-0637\r\nCVE-2010-0638: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-0638\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to update:\r\n--------------\r\nMake sure the line\r\n\r\n\tdeb http://security.debian.org squeeze/updates main contrib non-free\r\n\r\nis present in your /etc/apt/sources.list. Of course, you also need the line\r\npointing to your normal squeeze mirror. You can use\r\n\r\n\taptitude update && aptitude dist-upgrade\r\n\r\nto install the updates.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore information:\r\n-----------------\r\nMore information about which security issues affect Debian can be found in the \r\nsecurity tracker:\r\n\r\n\thttp://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/\r\n\r\nA list of all known unfixed security issues is at\r\n\r\n\thttp://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/status/release/testing\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-testing-security-announce-request@lists.debian.org\r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
