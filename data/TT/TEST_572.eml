The question is how much extra \nwork, both up front, and then on an ongoing basis.  I know \nnothing about how the trust system is working (still waiting for \nthat long-promised server code to be published), but now that \nit\'s been turned on, and the more info that\'s coming out about \nit, the more concerned I\'m becoming that it\'s extremely easy to \ngame; that the initial amount of work to set up a gaming agent \nis low, and that once it\'s set up, it can be "fire and forget" \nin terms of continuing to operate in a way that\'s not easy to \ndistinguish from real user behavior.\n\n> Sure, you can find a way to work almost any system, but few \n> users (spammers)\n> will actually take the time to game the system.\n\nAnother concern I have with the way the system might be working \nis that it might not actually require very many gamers at all to \nutterly undermine the whole system.  There are a certain number \nof possible universes where the trust system is very sensitive \nto liars, or misclassifiers of "gray" mail, or both.  It\'s not \nclear yet whether this universe is one of those or not.\n\n> That means that we might have a system that is less than 100% \n> effective, but\n> perfect accuracy and effectiveness comes at a prohibitive cost. \n> (Complex\n> systems, time numbing hours of coding etc.)\n\nYou do need a certain level of accuracy though, or the filter is \nnot economically worthwhile.  If you only filter 75% of spam, \nyou\'re wasting your time.  Some people receive on the order of a \n10:1 ratio of spam:real mail -- 75% means the ratio adjusts to \n5:2 which is still shitty.  95% makes it 1:2, which is better.  \n99% makes it 1:10 which is quite nice.  As the global ratio of \nspam:mail rises, this problem gets somewhat more important.  \nWith an order of magnitude worsening of the incoming spam:real \nratio, 100:1, 99% effective still works OK.  75% effective is \nnow really, really shitty.\n\n\n> I can\'t vouch for Razor currently, as I\'m not at all \n> knowledgeable.

Time will also tell how good the system is at \nadjusting over time to gaming strategies.\n\n> I put up with some garbage results in SA, simply because it \n> blocks most of\n> my spam, without too many false positives.\n\nSA definitely has a non-zero FP rate, and always will have.  I \nwould argue that any system will have a non-zero FP rate, \nincluding the "no filter" filter -- humans make mistakes too \nsometimes!  As spammer strategies evolve over time though, I\'m \nfairly sure that SA will be able to adjust and compensate.  If \nspammers figure out how to easily pollute the SpamNet trust \nsystem, I\'m not sure how easy it\'ll be to replace the trust \nsystem with something else.\n\n> Perhaps Craig is just theorizing, but I just thought I\'d offer my two\n> ity-bits.\n\nLots of theorizing, most of it based on little data.  The key \npremises I\'m worrying about though are:\n\n1. Trust system is easy to pollute\n2. Trust system is not personal, which makes the assumption that \nall honest voters agree on what constitutes spam\n\n\n> Somthing simple, and actually implimented, that works \n> reasonably well, is\n> better than somthing that works perfectly, but will never be \n> implimented\n> because of it\'s cost.

It has great promise, and \nI\'m hoping that once the wrinkles are worked through, it\'ll add \nanother powerful tool in the war on spam -- I\'m just concerned \nthat it\'s getting off on the wrong foot and might not be able to \nrecover.\n\nC\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nRazor-users mailing list\nRazor-users@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-users\n\n\n', 'subject': "Re: [Razor-users] What's wrong with the Razor servers now?"}
