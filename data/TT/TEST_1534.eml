{'body': '--]\n--] Anyone heard of this law before?\n\nBack when I was running the WSMF shoutcast server these restrictions were\njust being placed on netcasters. Most folks laughed it off. Now with the\nlicense fees its not laughable anymore. If you pay the fee you are bound\nto the restrictions, if you dont your running the criminal line.\n\nI still run a stream up on live365. Its been playing the same 10 hour\nblock of Jean Shepard shows for the last year. I really should change them\nup.\n\nIf I were going to do the old WSMF shoutcast now adays I would either\nspend lots of time going over regulations to see what I can or cannot do\nor I would just chuck the regs out and do what I want. Or I might write\nsome apps to stay in regs ..I dont know..one thing is for sure it\ndefiently takes the spontaneous edge off things:)-\n\nF Murray Abraham\nF Scott Fitzgerald\nF Hillary Rossen\n\n-tom\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: Digital radio playlists are prohibited?!'}
