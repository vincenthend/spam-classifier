The company\'s stock<br>\ndipped below three this week. And network execs<br>\nare openly questioning whether the digital recorder,<br>\nwhich permits skipping commercials with a few <br>\nclicks of the remote, will destroy their advertising<br>\nmodels. There even have been hints that the <br>\nnetworks could support a move by the cable <br>\nindustry to offer a PVR that does not permit<br>\ncommercial skipping. And that PVR would not <br>\nbe a TiVo. <br>\n<br>\nTo its credit, TiVo has been remarkably successful <br>\nat building brand loyalty and awareness. TiVo <br>\nreports that 97 percent of its subscribers have<br>\nrecommended the service to a friend. And when<br>\npeople talk about PVRs, they say TiVo. (Just <br>\nlike the way people say "Coke" when they talk<br>\nabout soft drinks. )<br>\n<br>\nBut Wall Street, the media and the industry <br>\nare all growing impatient. TiVo needs to start<br>\nputting some big numbers on the board -- <br>\nand it needs to do it this holiday season. If <br>\nit doesn\'t, stock analysts who have supported TiVo <br>\nuntil now will run for the hills. That will push<br>\nthe company\'s stock price down even further. And<br>\nif that happens, TiVo could have just two choices:<br>\nSell the company under duress or wait until its <br>\nfunding dries up. <br>\n<br>\nConsequently, I predict that TiVo will launch <br>\nan intensive marketing blitz over the next <br>\nfive months, right through the holiday season.<br>\nThe blitz will include a sharp increase in <br>\nretail distribution, TV advertising and PR <br>\nefforts. The company needs to show Wall <br>\nStreet -- and the industry -- that it will be <br>\nthe brand leader in the PVR category. And it<br>\nneeds to show that it can generate<br>\nmass consumer demand. <br>\n<br>\nHow does TiVo demonstrate that?<br>\n<br>\nAnything short of 750,000 subs at year\'s end<br>\nwill have people questioning whether TiVo has<br>\nthe right stuff. Cable execs, who are watching<br>\nTiVo closely, might decide that adding the <br>\nservice is not such a great selling point <br>\nafter all. And Echostar, which currently does<br>\nnot have an agreement with TiVo, may decide<br>\nto stay with its unbranded PVR service after <br>\nits merger with DIRECTV is approved in D.C. <br>\n(TiVo currently has a partnership with DIRECTV,<br>\nbut it\'s unclear what will happen to the deal if <br>\nthe merger is approved.) <br>\n<br>\nSo there is much at stake -- and it\'s not extreme<br>\nto say that TiVo\'s ultimate future could be decided<br>\nin the next several months. <br>\n<br>\nWill it succeed? I predict that TiVo will achieve<br>\na partial success. The company will boost its <br>\nsubscriber numbers and it will maintain its claim<br>\nas the #1 PVR service. However, in time, I <br>\nalso predict it will decide to sell the company<br>\nto a large media outfit, such as Sony or perhaps<br>\neven Liberty Media. This would give TiVo the <br>\nnecessary funding and industry connections<br>\nfor long-term growth and survival.<br>\n<br>\nTo see more predictions on the future of TV, <br>\nclick below! <br>\n\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nBreaking News\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nhttp://rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=tpysjsn6.e9iqjsn6.rqhvuqn6&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tvpredictions.com\nDid you know that...<br>\n<br>\n* Cox Cable has decided to slow down its <br>\nroll-out of Video on Demand?<br>\n<br>\n* Consumers have no idea what HDTV is <br>\nall about, according to a new study?<br>\n<br>\n* One top network exec says viewers may <br>\nsoon have to pay for off-air, free TV? <br>\n<br>\n* According to the Associated Press, <br>\nthe cable news networks may be spreading fear<br>\nin our culture?<br>\n<br>\n* Las Vegas says West Wing\'s Martin Sheen<br>\nis a shoo-in for a Best Actor Emmy? <br>\n<br>\nThese are just some of the many stories now <br>\navailable for reading at TVPredictions.com <br>\nYou can also read our prediction on CNN and<br>\nLarry King, our expose of Forrester Research<br>\nand Josh Bernoff, and perhaps our most <br>\nprovocative story, "Sex and the Interactive <br>\nTV." <br>\n<br>\nClick below to get the latest on the future of <br>\nTV! <br>\n\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nComing Attractions!\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nhttp://rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=tpysjsn6.e9iqjsn6.rqhvuqn6&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tvpredictions.com\nThe TVPredictions.com newsletter is published<br>\nevery Friday.
