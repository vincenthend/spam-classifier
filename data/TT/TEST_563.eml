{'body': 'Some time ago, my slrn stopped being able to talk to my local news\r\nserver, and I\'m just now trying to troubleshoot it.  I suspect this has\r\na really obvious answer, but because I\'m not at all familiar with IPv6,\r\nI\'m not seeing it.  I\'m running sid, mostly up to date.\r\n\r\nApparently, the problem is that inetd has leafnode listening on IPv6,\r\nbut not on IPv4.  I think I need to either get slrn to work with IPv6,\r\nor get leafnode listening on IPv4.  Actually I\'d like to know how to do\r\nboth.  I\'d very much appreciate any pointers you can give me.\r\n\r\n\t$ netstat -l | grep nntp\r\n\ttcp6       0      0 [::]:nntp               [::]:* LISTEN\r\n\r\n\t$ telnet :: 119\r\n\tTrying ::...\r\n\tConnected to ::.\r\n\tEscape character is \'^]\'.\r\n\t200 Leafnode NNTP Daemon, version 1.11.7 running at ip6-localhost (my fqdn: a.b.org)\r\n\r\n\ttelnet localhost 119\r\n\tTrying 127.0.0.1...\r\n\ttelnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused\r\n\r\nThis is surprising, because I thought you had to specifically tell\r\ninetd to use IPv6.  My inetd.conf has this line:\r\n\r\nnntp stream tcp nowait news /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/leafnode\r\n\r\n... but neither loosening my /etc/hosts.* files nor removing tcpd from\r\nthe loop seems to help.\r\n\r\nI\'m a total newb regarding IPv6.  Currently my environment has:\r\n\tNNTPSERVER=localhost\r\n... which some time ago allowed slrn to read from the local news server.\r\n\r\nChanging to \r\n\tNNTPSERVER=::\r\ndoes not satisfy slrn:\r\n\tConnecting to host  ...\r\n\tFailed to resolve\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\n-- \r\nmonique\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
