This was covered in one of the amateur rags, maybe Sky\nand Telescope or even Scienterrific American, long before there was any\nweb to speak of, but you\'d think a 400km gash in the Earth would be\npretty easy to find ;) I remember it from an issue perhaps in the very\nlate 80\'s or early 90\'s.\n\nIt\'s interesting to note that NT7 and many other NEO bodies are all on\ntrajectories that approach the Earth from under the ecliptic, so with\nthe Earth tilt, South America becomes a pretty good target.  In trying\nto find you a site through Google, I turned up several different\nimpact sites in Venezuela and Brazil, with ages ranging from 251M to\n70 years, but not the 400km gash from the above story.  \n\nThe only google refs I found from that period is one in Arizona\n(famous impact crater) and another in NM; do wish I had noted the\nactual South American /country/ that contains the scar; Venezuela\nsticks in my mind but I can\'t be certain.  \n\nhttp://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/images/meteorcrater.html\n\n-- \nGary Lawrence Murphy <garym@teledyn.com> TeleDynamics Communications Inc\nBusiness Innovations Through Open Source Systems: http://www.teledyn.com\n"Computers are useless.
