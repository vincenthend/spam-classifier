Check the ram dimms are certified for \r\nyou motherboard and also, look into the BIOS voltages are the correct \r\nones for you type of ram.\r\n\r\n3/ Hard disks health. You can test this with "smartcl".\r\n\r\nBeing a brand-new computer I would suspect for bad hardware or assembly \r\nproblems :-/\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\n\r\n-- \r\nCamale\xc3\xb3n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
