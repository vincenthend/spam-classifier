(the loss of the ability to have a\r\ndifferent background for each desktop was a KDE showstopper.  So the\r\nforced downgrade prompted me to actually take a serious look at other\r\ndesktop environments.   And had that not happened, I would not be\r\nusing Enlightenment on all my Linux boxes today.  I have become quite\r\nenamored with Enlightenment, and now see no need whatsoever to go back\r\nto KDE or switch to Gnome.\r\n\r\nGranted, I will happily use various KDE and Gnome based tools if\r\nneeded.  That is no big deal.  But E (with the Steampunk theme)  is\r\nnow my environment of choice.  :)  Only drawback so far I have\r\nencountered is the inability to change the background color on the\r\ndesktop if the wallpaper image does not fill the entire screen.  It\r\ncan be a bit hard on the eyes with that harsh white background, but I\r\nthink I can get used to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
