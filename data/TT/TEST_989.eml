For this reason, NVIDIA is dropping support, on new GPUs, for the\r\nxf86-video-nv driver.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\n- NVIDIA will continue to support the existing functionality and\r\nexisting level of acceleration in the nv driver for existing GPUs,\r\non existing, and (within reason) future, X server versions.\r\n\r\n- NVIDIA will not support the xf86-video-nv driver on Fermi or\r\nlater GPUs.\r\n\r\n- NVIDIA will not support DisplayPort, on any GPU, in the\r\n xf86-video-nv driver."\r\n***\r\n\r\nSo I think the "nv" driver will keep the same "bugs|features" that has \r\nright now and will still get some security patches, but I\'m afraid that\'s \r\nall we (linux users) can expect.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xb9 http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg/2010-March/049749.html\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\n\r\n-- \r\nCamale\xc3\xb3n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
