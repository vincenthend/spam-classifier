{'body': "From nobody Fri Sep  7 01:05:21 2018\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\n\nHi,\r\n\r\nWhen copying and pasting a .ps or a .pdf file, or a serie of such files,\r\nthe resulting (i.e. pasted) files' icon is often the `snippets' one,\r\ni.e. the one which designates a broken/corrupted file. However, when\r\nright-clicking on the files, their content appears as the icon, i.e. the\r\n`snippets' icon disappears. Why? Is it normal? I do not like copying and\r\npasting files and seeing such an icon, because one might think that\r\nthese are corrupted files.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n--=20\r\nMerciadri Luca\r\nSee http://www.student.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/~merciadri/\r\nI use PGP.
