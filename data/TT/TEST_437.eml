But what I mean is that someone should care to\r\nget the code compiled on newer libraries. This could be challenging though\r\nif the code is working ATM, it\'s not that much effort to keep it running at\r\nleast for the next few years.\r\n\r\nThe interest is present I think, but not in the focus of interest of kde\r\nmanagement/development team. I personally could and will make a repo for my\r\nneeds ... but it does not seem to be urgent ATM. If someone starts similar\r\nproject I would love to know and join.\r\n\r\nHm, so we have to think about doing something like kde3.10 for debian\r\nsqueeze. I personally hate k/ubuntu but there are few very useful features\r\nin the 3.10 version there.\r\n\r\nThis plan could cover 3-4 years. And in that time kde4 should have matured\r\nenough to fit our needs.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know kde3 is not in squeeze (apps are supported but framework\r\nnot) or am I wrong?\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nregards\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
