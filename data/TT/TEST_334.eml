For example \r\nfor assigning the combination AltGr-2 (AltGr is the right-Alt, if not \r\nmarked as such):\r\n\r\nxmodmap -e "keycode 0x0B =  2 at 0x010000b2"\r\n\r\nTo automate this add that line in your .xsession or .xinitrc.\r\nFor many changes to the keyboard make your own .xmodmap file\r\nand add xmodmap .xmodmap in your .xsession or .xinitrc file.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\tIonel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
