Does it work if you run the command \r\nupdate-updmap and try again?\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I have two suggestions:\r\n\r\n1) Send and email to the debian-tex mailing list \r\n(<http://lists.debian.org/debian-tex-maint/>). That list is the official \r\nmaintainer address for texlive-base, according to \r\n(<http://packages.qa.debian.org/t/texlive-base.html>).\r\n\r\n2) Report the problem as a bug. (<http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Reporting>).\r\n\r\nBefore doing any of those two, you should rewrite the example document \r\nto be as small and simple as possible (still showing the problem) and \r\nperhaps also translate the text to English.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nJohan\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
