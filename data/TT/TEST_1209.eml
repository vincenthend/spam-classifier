Leave your current kernel as-is\n2. Get the "alsa-driver" source rpm\n3. Rebuild and install resulting packages\n\nDrivers that are written to be easily compiled as modules (like ltmodem,\nNVidia, ALSA etc.) can easily be repackaged separately as rpms and ported\nas easily for various kernel rpms from the source rpm.\n\nAlso, what you describe is sort of the opposite of what rpm packaging is in\nmy mind. I see it more as a "one size fits all" achievement in the general\ncase. And kernel isn\'t an exception (although there are packages optimized\nfor various processors) since they all come with just about all the modules\nyou\'ll ever need. Make that "one size fits many" then if you want ;-)\n\nLast but not least : The kernel is something I\'m trying to keep away from\nin my packaging since I really don\'t want to see newbies screwing up their\nsystems because of packages on my website... same goes for GNOME, KDE and\nother major bits of the distribution since I also want people who happily\nuse my packages to be able to upgrade to the next Red Hat Linux release\nwithout having their system turned into another Ximian mess.\n\nMatthias\n\nPS: Yes Chris, I\'m worried about not giving you too much work! Less in fact\nsince you can easily answer "freshrpms.net!" to people asking how to play\nDVDs, right? ;-))))\n\n-- \nMatthias Saou                                World Trade Center\n-------------                                Edificio Norte 4 Planta\nSystem and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, Spain\nElectronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: ALSA (almost) made easy'}
