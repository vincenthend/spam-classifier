And I hope that someone who is both willing and able to do\r\nso steps up to the plate.  But withdrawing it from the distribution seems\r\nlike overkill to me, especially since you want to withdraw it from Squeeze\r\nand not Squeeze+1.  Lilo, as it exists today, works just fine for my\r\npurposes.  And apparently it works just fine for a lot of other people too.\r\n\r\nThe Lord bless you, William.\r\n\r\n-- \r\n  .\'\'`.
