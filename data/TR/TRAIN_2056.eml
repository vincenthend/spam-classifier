{'body': 'Hi all,\r\n\r\nAfter about a fortnight, I tried to update my Debian squeeze desktop,\r\nand I was using the mirror.cse.iitk.ac.in mirror. After downloading\r\nthe repository lists, it tells me there are no updates -- I am\r\nsurprised as I know that Gnome 2.30 is already in testing. Thinking\r\nthat it could be a problem with the mirror, I switch to\r\nftp.ch.debian.org and update. This time, it does say there are about\r\n300 updates.\r\n\r\nI issue a safe-upgrade, but the electricity goes out just as the\r\nupdates begin downloading. After I turn the computer back on, issuing\r\na safe-upgrade shows there are no updates! I try to aptitude update\r\nbut it thinks that the repositories are already updated, though\r\napt-cache show nautilus gives the version 2.28.4. As I was in a hurry\r\nat the time, I just deleted /var/lib/apt/lists, so aptitude had no\r\nchoice but to really download the lists. After this the safe-upgrade\r\nproceeded as usual. I realised after deleting /var/lib/apt/lists that\r\nI should have kept a copy, but too late.\r\n\r\nThough the problem is (in a sense) solved, I am curious as to how this\r\n(bug?) could have occurred. After all this I checked\r\nmirror.cse.iitk.ac.in  and it does have nautilus 2.30.1, so maybe the\r\nfirst no-updates scenario was also caused by this bug/problem.\r\n\r\nAbhishek\r\n--\r\nPlease cc me as I am not subscribed to debian-user.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
