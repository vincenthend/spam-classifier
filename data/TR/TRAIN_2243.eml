{'body': b"I need to setup a VPN between a few sites. From what I've read, the the\nchoices come down (on the Linux side) to IPsec (using FreeSWAN) or CIPE.\nIt seems that FreeSWAN is 'better', being an implementation of IPsec which\nis a standard. However, CIPE does the job as well for Linux clients and is\nsomewhat simpler to setup. \n\nThe problem is that it's not a pure Linux situation - a couple of the sites\nrun OS-X. I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to find an implementation of\nIPsec for OS-X, but I think CIPE is Linux only.\n\nSo, the question is for those of you have have implemented BOTH - is there a\nsignificant difference in setup time and hassle between CIPE and FreeSWAN ?\nIf CIPE is going to be much easier than dealing with FreeSWAN (and whatever\non the OS-X sites) then I'll simply get a Linux box for each of the remote\nsites - with the low price of hardware, it doesn't take much more complexity\nin software to make buying hardware to use simpler software economic.\n\n\n\nNiall\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n", 'subject': '[ILUG] VPN implementation'}
