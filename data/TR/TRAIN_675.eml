{'body': 'Are there keycodes for cut, copy and paste? I tried using the\n"obvious" XF86Copy and XF86Paste guesses but those did not work. For\nthat matter, where can one find a list of all available codes? I have\ngoogled for various combinations of "linux debian keycodes scancodes\nlist" but found no such list!\n\nThanks.\n\n-- \nDotan Cohen\n\nhttp://gibberish.co.il\nhttp://what-is-what.com\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
