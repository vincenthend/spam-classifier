{'body': 'Hello folks,\n\nI don\'t know when it happened but it must have been during some\n"aptitude upgrade" run lately: My console font turned from white to\ncyan. At first I thought that the red VGA signal had a bad contact,\nbut X came up in full color. Console apps can control the color to a\ncertain extent, but the default color is a really gross cyan which\nproduces weird color effects on an LCD with the thni Terminus fonts.\nIn other words, I can\'t live with it. Where is this controlled, and\nhow can it be switched back to white again?\n\nRegards,\nrobert\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
