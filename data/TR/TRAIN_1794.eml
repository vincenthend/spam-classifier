{'body': 'Hello folks,\r\n\r\nI don\'t know when it happened but it must have been during some\r\n"aptitude upgrade" run lately: My console font turned from white to\r\ncyan. At first I thought that the red VGA signal had a bad contact,\r\nbut X came up in full color. Console apps can control the color to a\r\ncertain extent, but the default color is a really gross cyan which\r\nproduces weird color effects on an LCD with the thni Terminus fonts.\r\nIn other words, I can\'t live with it. Where is this controlled, and\r\nhow can it be switched back to white again?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nrobert\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
