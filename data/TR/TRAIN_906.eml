{'body': "Hi,\n\nIn my build scripts, I have problems with some of the kernel packages.\n\nFor kernel-sources, I get :\n\nPackage kernel-source is a virtual package provided by:\n  kernel-source#2.4.18-3 2.4.18-3\n  kernel-source#2.4.18-3 2.4.18-3\n\non running apt-get install kernel-source\n\nNow, first of all, this doesn't really tell me what the two options are ;)\nSecond, is there some way I can tell apt-get to install either ? This is \ndone from automatic build scripts so I'd like it to proceed anyway.\n\nThanks,\nThomas\n\n-- \n\nThe Dave/Dina Project : future TV today ! - http://davedina.apestaart.org/\n<-*-                      -*->\nI'm alive.\nI can tell because of the pain.\n<-*- thomas@apestaart.org -*->\nURGent, the best radio on the Internet - 24/7 ! - http://urgent.rug.ac.be/\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n", 'subject': 'a problem with apt-get'}
