I don\'t think so :-)\n\n"Bonding" is for ethernet devices, nothing to do with using your \n"router\'s bandwith". Ethernet bonding is like hard disk raid: it will \nprevent for a "link" going down and you can use it to increasing \nthroughput but what you want to achieve is not done with that, as you \nwill be still facing the problem on how/where to route packages.\n\nAlso, bonding requires at least 2 ethernet adapters. \n\nA very good bonding tutorial:\n\nhttp://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/networking/bonding\n\nBut you may need something like this:\n\nHow To: Load Balancing & Failover With Dual/ Multi WAN / ADSL / Cable \nConnections on Linux\nhttp://blog.taragana.com/index.php/archive/how-to-load-balancing-failover-with-dual-multi-wan-adsl-cable-connections-on-linux/\n\nAnd I advance you is not an easy task :-P\n\nGreetings,\n\n-- \nCamalen\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
