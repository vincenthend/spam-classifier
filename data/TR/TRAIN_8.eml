Go ahead,\npost everything that I\'ve ever sent to you here. I\'ve sent mails only\nas long as the demands of your comments have warranted, filled only\nwith questions about what is broken for you in KDE 4 and links to bugs\non those very subjects. Rude or unpleasant? I think that you have me\nmistaken. I\'ll give to you the benefit of the doubt, publish something\nthat you think I wrote to you which is rude or unpleasant.\n\n\n>\xa0That is what I am complaining about. \xa0As I said above,\n> *I* have been getting them from Dotan, as you correctly state: \xa0"*Lisi*\n> shreef ..... *I* have been getting them." \xa0According to list policy I should\n> not be getting them. \xa0In addition, the last one was sent to the KDE list (to\n> which I do not subscribe) and not to this, which is the list with the thread.\n>\n> Perhaps you should read Dotan\'s last two emails to me (especially the last\n> one) before complaining about my complaint.\n>\n\nWhich messages exactly? "last two" is hard to identify given the\ndynamic nature of this list.\n\n\n> And my crime?? \xa0For which you too clearly feel that I should be subjected to\n> the unpleasant bullying in emails direct to me? \xa0I use KDE 3, but do not\n> intend to use KDE 4.\n>\n\nAll I did was ask about what issues you have with KDE 4 so that I\nmight fix them. You don\'t have to appreciate that, but I do not expect\nyou to turn it around and call that "rude and unpleasant". Maybe you\ndon\'t like KDE contributors taking an interest in your problems with\nthe software. Many other people do.\n\n\n-- \nDotan Cohen\n\nhttp://bido.com\nhttp://what-is-what.com\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
