KDE 3.5 in Lenny. KDE 4 in Squeeze unless=20\r\nsomeone - except the current Debian KDE / Qt developer team - does and=20\r\nmaintains KDE 3.5 packages that are co-installable and meet Debians high=20\r\npackaging standards.\r\n\r\nThis list is not for development issues like developing / maintaining KDE=20\r\n3.5 packages for Squeeze.\r\n\r\nSo IMHO any further request for KDE 3.5 in Squeeze is off topic on this=20\r\nlist as Debian KDE/Qt maintainers repeatedly said they won\'t.\r\n\r\nYou want KDE 3.5 for Squeeze? Spend your energy towards that goal. Here it=\r\n=20\r\napparently does not change the situation.\r\n\r\nCiao,\r\n=2D-=20\r\nMartin \'Helios\' Steigerwald - http://www.Lichtvoll.de\r\nGPG: 03B0 0D6C 0040 0710 4AFA  B82F 991B EAAC A599 84C7\r\n', 'subject': 'Re: Fwd: Re: Kde 3.5 ...'}
