KDE 3.5 in Lenny. KDE 4 in Squeeze unless \nsomeone - except the current Debian KDE / Qt developer team - does and \nmaintains KDE 3.5 packages that are co-installable and meet Debians high \npackaging standards.\n\nThis list is not for development issues like developing / maintaining KDE \n3.5 packages for Squeeze.\n\nSo IMHO any further request for KDE 3.5 in Squeeze is off topic on this \nlist as Debian KDE/Qt maintainers repeatedly said they won\'t.\n\nYou want KDE 3.5 for Squeeze? Spend your energy towards that goal. Here it \napparently does not change the situation.\n\nCiao,\n-- \nMartin \'Helios\' Steigerwald - http://www.Lichtvoll.de\nGPG: 03B0 0D6C 0040 0710 4AFA  B82F 991B EAAC A599 84C7\n', 'subject': 'Re: Fwd: Re: Kde 3.5 ...'}
