I have a 42U data center rack in my basement, and about\r\nhalf a dozen really old servers. They aren't really worth much from a\r\nfinancial standpoint, but at the same time, I use them as a sort of test\r\nlab. and I have a Tripp Lite 1000VA and an APC BackUPS 1000 (just replaced\r\nthe batteries) in the rack. I also have a BackUPS 350 for my workstation.\r\n\r\nIt's not about the cost of the hardware (as I said, almost everything is 32\r\nbit PIII/P4 class hardware that has little to no value in most business\r\nenvironments (which is how I came by it, by and large), but my data? Thats a\r\nwhole nother kettle of fish. It may only be important to me, but the point\r\nis that it *is* important to me.\r\n\r\n--b\r\n", 'subject': 'Re: [OT] Home UPS (was Filesystem recommendations)'}
