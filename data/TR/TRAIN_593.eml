In particular, I am thinking of the iwl3945 \nfirmware that is required to run my wireless card.\n\nIt doesn\'t matter what upstream wants to call source code.  The GPL(v2) \ndefines it as the preferred form for making modifications.  (GPLv2, section \n3.)  It is unlikely that the firmware was written in a hex editor (or \nequivalent).  Most likely it is C source for a freestanding (non-hosted) \nenvironment with some manufacturer-specific libraries, but it could also be in \nsome manufacturer-specific assembly code.  Either form would be better for \nmaking modifications than a binary blob.\n-- \nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr.           \t ,= ,-_-. =.\nbss@iguanasuicide.net            \t((_/)o o(\\_))\nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy \t `-\'(. .)`-\'\nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/        \t     \\_/\n', 'subject': 'Re: The future of "nv" driver (was: Linux compatible mainboards -another thought)'}
