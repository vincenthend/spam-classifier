In particular, I am thinking of the iwl3945=20\r\nfirmware that is required to run my wireless card.\r\n\r\nIt doesn\'t matter what upstream wants to call source code.  The GPL(v2)=20\r\ndefines it as the preferred form for making modifications.  (GPLv2, section=\r\n=20\r\n3.)  It is unlikely that the firmware was written in a hex editor (or=20\r\nequivalent).  Most likely it is C source for a freestanding (non-hosted)=20\r\nenvironment with some manufacturer-specific libraries, but it could also be=\r\n in=20\r\nsome manufacturer-specific assembly code.  Either form would be better for=\r\n=20\r\nmaking modifications than a binary blob.\r\n=2D-=20\r\nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr.           \t ,=3D ,-_-. =3D.\r\nbss@iguanasuicide.net            \t((_/)o o(\\_))\r\nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy \t `-\'(. .)`-\'\r\nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/        \t     \\_/\r\n', 'subject': 'Re: The future of "nv" driver (was: Linux compatible mainboards -another thought)'}
