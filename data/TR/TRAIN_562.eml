{'body': '> An illusionist has emerged after 24 hours underwater in a case in New York\'s\n> Times Square.\n\nI\'d just like to recommend the newest Viz to ukers just for the hilarious "David \nBlaine: Stalag Magician".  The ego\'d one is in a WWII prison camp and sort of \ntrying to escape.  Several times he seems to have escaped and the british \nofficers celebrate before it\'s revealed he\'s been buried alive or hiding in a \nfreezer.  At one point he\'s asked why and says "Well it\'s not for publicity" \nCracking stuff.\n\nStew\n-- \nStewart Smith\nScottish Microelectronics Centre, University of Edinburgh.\nhttp://www.ee.ed.ac.uk/~sxs/\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
