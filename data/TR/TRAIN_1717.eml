The totality of what we have now\ncome from various parts of all the following re: sound recordings:\n\n1998 - DMCA\n1995 - Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act\n1992 - Audio Home Recording Act\n1976 - Copyright Act amendment\n1972 - Copyright Act amendment\n\nIt is worth noting that many people have forgotten about the 1976\nCopyright Act Amendment which created the foundational law stating that\nthe copyright owners have the right to limit personal use of audio\nrecordings after First Sale even if you are not "making copies" in any\ncommercial sense.  Sound recordings, for many intents and purposes, are\nexplicitly excluded from Fair Use by the 1976 amendment.\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: Digital radio playlists are prohibited?!'}
