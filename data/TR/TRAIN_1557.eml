IN MY DEPARTMENT, WE DISCOVERED AN \nABANDONED SUM OF US$12.5,000,000 (Twelve POINT FIVE MILLION US \nDOLLARS ONLY) IN AN ACCOUNT THAT BELONGED TO ONE OF OUR FOREIGN CUSTOMERS WHO \nDIED ALONG WITH HIS ENTIRE FAMILY ON NOVEMBER 1994 IN A GHASTLY PLANE \nCRASH. SINCE WE GOT INFORMATION ABOUT HIS DEATH, WE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING \nHIS NEXT-OF-KIN TO COME OVER AND CLAIM HIS MONEY BECAUSE WE CANNOT \nRELEASE IT UNLESS SOMEBODY APPLIED FOR IT AS NEXT-OF-KIN, OR RELATION TO \nTHE DECEASED AS INDICATED IN OUR BANKING GUIDELINES. UNFORTUNATELY, \nNOBODY HAS COME FOWARD TO CLAIM THIS MONEY. \n  \nIT IS BASED ON THIS THAT SOME OFFICIALS IN MY DEPARTEMENT AND I HAVE \nDECIDED TO ESTABLISH A CORDIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU, HENCE \nMY CONTACTING YOU. WE WANT YOU TO PRESENT YOURSELF AS THE NEXT-OF-KIN \nOR RELATION OF THE DECEASED SO THAT THE FUND CAN BE REMITTED INTO YOUR \nACCOUNT. \n  \nMOREOVER, WE DO NOT WANT THE MONEY TO GO INTO THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT \nAS UNCLAIMED BILL. THE BANKING LAW AND GUIDELINES HERE STIPULATE THAT \nANY ACCOUNT ABANDONED OR IS DORMANT FOR A PERIOD OF YEARS IS DEEMED \nCLOSED AND ALL MONEY CONTAINED THEREIN FORFEITED TO THE GOVERNMENT \nTREASURY ACCOUNT. \n  \nNOW IT IS BEING SPECULATED THAT THE ABOVE SUM WILL BE TRANSFERED INTO \nTHE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT AS AN UNCLAIMED FUND ON OR BEFORE DECEMBER \n2002. THE REASON FOR REQUESTING YOU TO PRESENT YOURSELF AS NEXT-OF-KIN \nIS OCCASIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE DECEASED (CUSTOMER) WAS A \nFOREIGNER. \n  \nTHE MODE OF SHARING AFTER A SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER OF THE MONEY INTO YOUR \nACCOUNT: 60% TO MY COLLEAGUES AND I; FOR THE ROLE YOU WILL BE EXPECTED \nTO PLAY IN THIS DEAL, WE HAVE AGREED TO GIVE YOU THIRTY PERCENT (30%) \nOF THE TOTAL SUM, AND 10% FOR THE EXPENSES WE ARE GOING TO ENCOUNTER BY \nTHE TWO PARTIES AT THE COURSE OF THIS TRANSACTION.THEREFORE YOU ARE \nEXPECTED TO REPLY THIS LETTER INDICATING YOUR READINESS AND INTEREST TO \nPARTICIPATTE IN THIS BUSINESS. \n  \nAFTER RECEIVING YOUR REPLY, YOU WILL BE COMMUNICATED TO WITH THE EXACT \nSTEPS TO TAKE. \n  \nI EXPECT YOUR URGENT RESPONSE EITHER BY EMAIL TO :othema2002@37.com    \n TO ENABLE US CONCLUDE THIS TRANSACTION ON YOUR REPLY I SHALL CALL YOU AND GIVE \nYOU MY PHONE NUMBER FOR SECURITY REASONS.\nURGENTLY. \n  \nPLEASE TREAT THIS BUSINESS PROPOSAL AS STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL FOR \nSECURITY REASONS. \n  \nKIND PERSONAL REGARDS, \n  \nThema Ordi\nTel:27 83 6919246\n\n', 'subject': 'bank inheritance'}
