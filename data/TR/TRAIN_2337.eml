Two hard links to the same file are exactly equivalent - one is no more\nthe files "real" directory entry than is the other. OTOH a symlink is a special\nthing which is a link to a real file, and when the file linked to is erased, you\nend up with a broken symbolic link - you can\'t have a broken hard link (except\nof course in the case of a banjaxed filesystem).\n\n\nNiall\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users\' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: [ILUG] How to copy some files'}
