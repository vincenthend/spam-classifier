It is a matter of segmenting a market, and manufacturers want \nnetbooks to have specific capabilities for marketing reasons, not \ntechnical ones.\n\nI wanted to suggest that you choose a machine based on your needs, and I \nwanted you to question your initial assumptions.\n\nHowever, I see you have done some thinking about it, and future-proofing \n*does* seem like a good reason to get a dual-core, 64-bit machine.\n\nWith 64 bits, you will need more memory, so I suggest you look for a \nmachine that can use 4 GB of memory.\n\nI suggest also that you make sure that the machine you get can use \nsolid-state storage devices.  In time, the advantages of SSDs will make \nthem compelling, though now they are too expensive.  That is, you will \nprobably buy a machine with a standard notebook HD, but if you ever need \nto replace it, being able to replace it with an SSD gives you another \noption.  This also is in the area of future-proofing.\n\n\nJust a couple of suggestions.  I would like to hear more from other \npeople.  (I am also contemplating a portable computer purchase.)\n\n\nMAA\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe". Trouble?
