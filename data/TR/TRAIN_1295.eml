{'body': 'Greetings;\r\n\r\nI have looked for ways to fix this problem several times in \r\nthe passed few months and have had no success.\r\n\r\nRecently several companies have started displaying a large \r\nfavicon in the address bar when you go to their site. In \r\nseveral cases it takes up over half of the space in the \r\naddress bar and makes it extremely difficult to read the URL.\r\n\r\nOne site even claimed that this is a "security feature" as \r\nit would enable the users to tell they were really on the \r\nbank\'s site and not some scammer of phisher site. Sure! Like \r\nnobody else could figure out how to do that!\r\n\r\nAnyway, can anyone tell me how to get rid of these eyesores?\r\nI have already set browser.chrome.favicons and \r\nbrowser.chrome.site_icons to false and \r\nbrowser.chrome.image_icons.max_size to 0, but no difference!\r\n\r\nTIA for any help!\r\n\r\nDennis\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
