Given Camaleon\'s report of\r\nhis investigation, I think it is like that the real reason is something else,\r\nnot on your list. Perhaps, for instance, he is insane and is confined to a\r\nmental institution where some of the more lucid inmates are allowed access\r\nto the computers and internet. Whatever the real reason, Camaleon seems to\r\nhave exhausted the publicly available options for communication. I thank him.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nPaul E Condon           \r\npecondon@mesanetworks.net\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
