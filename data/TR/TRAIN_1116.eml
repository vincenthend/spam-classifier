{'body': 'Hello:\r\n\r\nI=92ve recently had a few users get new Snow Leopard machines.  They all =\r\nare having problems similar to those described in the =93FileID race =\r\ndetected=94 (Jan 19, 2010) of this list.  I share home directories using =\r\nNFS (Mac OS X Server 10.5.8).  My Leopard clients do not exhibit this =\r\nbehavior.\r\n\r\nThe Snow Leopard clients are all patched up to 10.6.3.  I searched this =\r\nlist and did not see any information indicating that this bug, alluded =\r\nto by Jim Luther (response to initial =93FileID race detected=94 posting =\r\nalso on Jan 19, 2010), has been fixed by now.  Does anyone have some =\r\nconcrete information about this bug?  Thanks a bunch for your help.\r\n\r\n--\r\nPeter Schwenk  ||  Campus IT Associate 3\r\nMathematical Sciences  ||  University of Delaware\r\nNewark, DE  19716-2553  ||  (302) 831-0437 (v)\r\nschwenk @ math . udel . edu  ||  http://www.math.udel.edu/~schwenk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
