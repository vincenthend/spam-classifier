{'body': 'Hello:\n\nI’ve recently had a few users get new Snow Leopard machines.  They all are having problems similar to those described in the “FileID race detected” (Jan 19, 2010) of this list.  I share home directories using NFS (Mac OS X Server 10.5.8).  My Leopard clients do not exhibit this behavior.\n\nThe Snow Leopard clients are all patched up to 10.6.3.  I searched this list and did not see any information indicating that this bug, alluded to by Jim Luther (response to initial “FileID race detected” posting also on Jan 19, 2010), has been fixed by now.  Does anyone have some concrete information about this bug?  Thanks a bunch for your help.\n\n--\nPeter Schwenk  ||  Campus IT Associate 3\nMathematical Sciences  ||  University of Delaware\nNewark, DE  19716-2553  ||  (302) 831-0437 (v)\nschwenk @ math . udel . edu  ||  http://www.math.udel.edu/~schwenk\n\n\n\n\n\n _______________________________________________\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
