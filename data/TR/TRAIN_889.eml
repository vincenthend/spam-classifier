{'body': 'I have a similar one:\nBubba calls up the DEA and tells em that JoeBob is growing pot and \nhiding it in his back yard.  They go over, find nothing, and go ask Bubba \nwhat he was talking about.  Bubba tells em it\'s in JoeBob\'s woodpile.  So \nthey go chop up all the wood and look through it and scatter it all over \nthe yard, but find nothing.  They ask Bubba again, and he tells them that \nJoeBob must have already sold it, so they leave.  Bubba calls up JoeBob:\nBubba: You get your wood chopped?\'\nJoeBob: Yep, thanks, I\'ll give ya 15 bucks tomorrow.
