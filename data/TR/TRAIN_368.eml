{'body': 'I\'m developing a QT app on Windows, and am using a WSH javascript to control output from the application. I have everything working, except I want to make a track blend 50% with the background and it just doesn\'t seem to work. Here is what I\'m using:\n\nqtTargetMovie.QTControl.Movie.Tracks(3).top = qtTargetMovie.QTControl.Movie.height-qtTargetMovie.QTControl.Movie.Tracks(3).height;\nqtTargetMovie.QTControl.Movie.Tracks(3).TransferMode = QTTransferModesEnum.qtTransferModeBlend;\nqtTargetMovie.QTControl.Movie.Tracks(3).OperationColor = "32768,32768,32768";\nqtTargetMovie.QTControl.Movie.Tracks(3).HighQualityMode = true;\n\nThe first line is changing the location of the track, which it does just fine, so I know I have the right track addressed. The next line just doesn\'t seem to happen. The track is always set to Dither when I check the Movie Properties. I am using version 7.6.6 of QT on Windows.\n\nI also tried:\n\nqtTargetMovie.QTControl.Movie.Tracks(3).TransferMode = QTTransferModesEnum.qtTransferModeStraighAlphaBlend;\n\nI\'m using the book "QuickTime For .NET and COM Developers" by John Cromie as my reference (which is excellent, btw).\n\n\nPatrick Besong\nManager, Creative Design & Development\nEducation Technology Services\nThe Pennsylvania State University\n210 Rider Bldg.
