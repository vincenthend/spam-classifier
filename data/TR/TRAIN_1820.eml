{'body': 'From nobody Fri Sep  7 01:04:42 2018\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1\n\nHello,\r\n\r\nI\'m curious as to the different ways one can create a USB install stick, for\r\nthe purpose of installing Debian.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to do it by\r\na) acquiring (where?) a boot.img.gz file, and then doing "zcat boot.img.gz >\r\n/dev/sdc". Then load a netboot iso to the disc.\r\nb) making a FAT/FAT32 partition on the stick, and then doing "syslinux\r\n/dev/sdXX", copying vmlinuz and initrd.gz to the stick\r\nc) using Unetbootin with an .iso file\r\n\r\nI like the way Unetbootin allows one to use a larger .iso (dvd, or full cd\r\niso). The downside of a) and b) is that you can only use the smaller netboot\r\n.isos, and if I wanted to load a few more files onto the disc for use I\r\nwouldn\'t have the room to do so.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know another method? I\'m particularly interested in knowing the\r\nway to do what Unetbootin does manually, so that I could load a cd/dvd iso\r\nonto the stick after making it boot-able.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJames\r\n', 'subject': 'Different ways of creating a USB-install stick'}
