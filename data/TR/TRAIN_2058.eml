With C it just doesnt seem as wrong to\nbe crawling around in registers and things. Quite frankly you cant fit\n_that_ big of a project into a 32K ROM, so large project issues dont matter\nas much in the embedded world.\n\nAnd in the realtime space, or when you have data coming in at 2Gbit/sec\n[fibrechannel], every cycle DOES count.\n\n> The real issue is compiler availability.
