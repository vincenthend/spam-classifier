I can clearly\npick out my house on a 60\'x120\' lot using it.  It may be\nadequate for your purposes.  And in public places, such\nas the capitol building, I can pick out individual people,\nthough I obviously can\'t tell who they are.  Try, for example,\n\n   http://www.mapquest.com/\n\nTo see actual photographs, click on "Aerial map" in the\nupper right hand corner.  By default, it shows street names\ntoo, but you can turn that off by clicking off the check\nbox for "show labels".  The zoom control is in the upper\nleft-hand corner of the picture.\n\nHTH\n\n-- \n  .\'\'`.
