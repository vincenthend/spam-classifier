I bought it seperately but it\'s also Software originally\nbelonging to a laptop but a different model than my own. \n\nMaybe this might play a role, but i\'m far away from being an expert in\nthis items.\n\nOne can read on some Linux websites which deal with this energy saving\nproblem, that it makes no sense anyway to change, for example, your cpu\nstate in order to save battery power, i.e. that it is useless to choose\nthe mode "powersave" or "conservative"  for saving power. On the other\nside. it is likewise useless to choose the mode "performance" to tune\nyour cpu efficiency.\n\nFor me this makes sense. Modern cpu\'s are flexible enough to quickly\nchange between "low" and "performance" if needed. Modern notebook hdd\'s\nare likewise already optimized for energy saving modes. \n\nBut something must be different between windows and linux. Using my\nwindows there is indeed a different if i would set the power management\nto "performance" or to "powersave". This makes nearly an hour or a half\ndifference in battery lifetime of my multiboot laptop! Of course this\ndrepends on what you do, but the difference is obvious.\n\nUsing my Debian i seldom reach a larger time span as if using windows in\n"performance" mode, in spite of it is so "quiet" when working with it or\nwhen idle, and windows always is so "restless" as if always something\nhappens on the disk, some processes are running etc.\n\nMaybe this after all has something to do with the different kernels? \n\nGreetings Dirk \n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
