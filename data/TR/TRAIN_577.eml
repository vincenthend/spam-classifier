{'body': 'Hi,\n\nThis has been hashed over a few times on various lists, now I finally got \naround to doing something about it... You can now add\n"rpm http://koti.welho.com/pmatilai/ redhat/8.0 task" to your sources.list \nand after apt-get update you can find out what\'s available with \n\'apt-cache search ^task-\'\n\nThese are generated directly from comps.xml of RH8.0 so they contain \nexactly the same packages as you\'ll get by choosing the various categories \nat install time. I didn\'t bother including SRPMS for these as they are \nrather uninteresting, if you want you can re-generate the .specs by \nrunning http://koti.welho.com/pmatilai/comps2task/comps2task.py.\n\nBTW the repository only contains the task-packages, you\'ll need an \napt-enabled mirror of RH8.0 in your sources.list to actually do anything \nwith it.\n\n-- \n\t- Panu -\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Debian-style task-packages for RH8.0 available'}
