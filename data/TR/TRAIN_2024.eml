You can use the\n-dumpaudio option to get the raw audio data out of the file.  I am\nusually not trying to get the raw audio however, because it might be\ncompressed or encoded in weird ways. I usally want to have a nice\nuncompressed wav file that I can work with. And mplayer is pretty\nhandy for that...\n\nSo many choices!\n\nPhil\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe". Trouble?
