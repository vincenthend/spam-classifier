You can use the\r\n-dumpaudio option to get the raw audio data out of the file.  I am\r\nusually not trying to get the raw audio however, because it might be\r\ncompressed or encoded in weird ways. I usally want to have a nice\r\nuncompressed wav file that I can work with. And mplayer is pretty\r\nhandy for that...\r\n\r\nSo many choices!\r\n\r\nPhil\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
