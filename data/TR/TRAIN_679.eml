Remove the old one, then do:\n\n rpm -Uvh libvorbis-*\n\n RPM then assumes that you want both versions installed at the same time,\nand does so. Why you can't do this after you have one library already\ninstalled is beyond me.\n\nKate\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n", 'subject': 'Re: [ILUG] rpm dependencies'}
