There are security related \r\nissues in 0.95 (DoS etc.?) [1] that might affect(?) volatile - futhermore the \r\nclamav-people are suggesting to use the latest version [2] - that is 0.96.\r\nVolatile itself is not supported by the security team [3] and the security \r\nteam refuses the support the current stable version [4].\r\n\r\nAs a sysop running lenny/clamav on a few hosts, I started building clamav from \r\nsource and reading clamav\'s announce list.\r\nBut I wonder, what does it mean in the long run:\r\n- Will volatile be updated to 0.96 soon?\r\n- Will clamav (in volatile) receive official security support?\r\n- Are there any (better supported) alternatives to clamav in lenny?\r\n- Afair there is no specific EOL-/Kill-Switch in clamav: ClamAV <= 0.94 is \r\nunable to handle "big" incremental updates and a "too" big update was \r\nshipped. Is it - from a naive point of view - just a bug that can be fixed in \r\ndebian [5]? Just apply the given patch [6] in lenny\'s clamav and be \r\nhappy? ;-)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKeep smiling\r\nyanosz\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \r\nhttp://git.clamav.net/gitweb?p=clamav-devel.git;a=blob_plain;f=ChangeLog;hb=clamav-0.95.3\r\n[2] http://www.clamav.net/lang/en/2009/10/05/eol-clamav-094/\r\n[3] http://www.debian.org/volatile/index.en.html\r\n[4] http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2009/msg00228.html\r\n[5] https://wwws.clamav.net/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1395\r\n[6] https://wwws.clamav.net/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1395#c12\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-security-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
