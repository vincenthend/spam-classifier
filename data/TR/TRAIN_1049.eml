{'body': 'draw the pain\n\n"Ken never wrote about this method, but he often demonstrated it in\nworkshops. Let us say you have a physical pain somewhere in your body. You\ndraw the pain in the air with your finger, about 30 cm (1 foot) high. Take\nabout 60 seconds to trace around the perimeter of the pain, carefully\nlistening to the pain to find the precise boundary between where it hurts\nand where it does not. Repeat. You will find that after about 10 minutes of\nthis the pain will shift, shrink or disappear. A variant of this is to\nimagine making a 3D model the pain in coloured clay."\n\nWorks!  There\'s this coworker - a real pain in my ass!  I used my middle\nfinger to trace his outline for about 60 seconds.  I listened to him, found\nthe boundary, and repeated the motion.  He left my office!\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com]On Behalf Of\nStephen D.

Just a big turnoff.  A good example would be\nthe difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but\nrelated, relaxation techniques including "betagenics",\nhypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics I\nobsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo /\nG-Force Dyno-Staff.\n\nI have to say however that, having found this while looking for\nsomething completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  I\nparticularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, the\nMindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.\n\nTo my internal ear, nearly all of these 60\'s based new-age vernacular\nseem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60\'s?) who needs some\nreligion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize.  Very\nirritating, but taken in small doses it\'s interesting to compare and\ncontrast with our (my) modern mental models.\n\nI found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and\njustify US/UN foreign policy and actions.\n\nhttp://mindprod.com/methods.html\nhttp://members.aol.com/inossence/Kenkey.html\nhttp://www.mindprod.com/\n(Apologies for the embedded HTML.)\n\nWe create the world we live in.\nA loving person lives in a loving world,\nA hostile person lives in a hostile world.\nEveryone you meet is your mirror.\n\nYou make yourself and others suffer just as much when you take offence\nas when you give offence. To be upset over what you don\'t have is to\nwaste what you do have.\n\nThe past is dead,\nThe future is imaginary,\nHappiness can only be\nin the Eternal Now Moment\n\nHow soon will you realize that the only thing you don\'t have is the\ndirect experience that there\'s nothing you need that you don\'t have.\n\nLove a person because he or she is there.\nThis is the only reason.\n\nHappiness happens when your consciousness is not dominated by addictions\nand demands~ and you experience life as a parade of preferences.\n\nThe\npurpose\nof our lives\nis to be free\nof all addictive traps,\nand thus\nbecome one\nwith the ocean of\nLiving Love.\n\n\nsdw\n\n--\nsdw@lig.net http://sdw.st\nStephen D.
