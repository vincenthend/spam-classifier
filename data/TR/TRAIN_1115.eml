I\'m assuming it\'s being deprecated as of KDE 4.4, but\r\nI\'d be surprised if it\'s removed in KDE 4.5, especially since delaying\r\nmigration is an official recommendation.\r\n\r\nOnce the DB mess is sorted out (KDE 4.5?), one can manually migrate the\r\ndata by running "kres-migrator".  I actually did this accidentally.  The\r\nmigrator _might_ also run if we remove the configuration bit, but I\'ve not\r\ntried.\r\n\r\n> > - Add a warning dialog during kdepim-runtime upgrade stating that\r\n> > \xa0kres-migrator will run by default and potentially consume a large amount\r\n> > \xa0of per-user disk space, unless migration is manually disabled by the\r\n> > \xa0above command.\r\n> \r\n> Personally, I would like to see such a warning, but I am not sure if\r\n> that is acceptable by Debian\'s standards. apt-listchanges exists for\r\n> a reason.\r\n\r\nIt extends beyond just a change in package behavior, it\'s a non-reversible\r\nand potentially aggravating alteration to user data.  I\'ve seen similar\r\nwarnings before, most recently to rebuild OpenOffice.org .rdb files due to\r\npossible corruption.\r\n\r\n> > - Reduce the default size of the InnoDB transaction logs in the Akonadi\r\n> > \xa0per-user MySQL configuration.\r\n> \r\n> Seems like the best bet to me.

Perhaps\r\nsomething to suggest manually doing in NEWS.\r\n\r\n> Also, what about /root?\r\n\r\nShould have same problem, if one runs a KDE desktop as root, which I do\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-kde-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
