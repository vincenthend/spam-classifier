It is based on the SysV unix family, so it's quite similar to\nother unixen like HPUX and SCO.\n\n Sun's hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. One\nof the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting your\nhardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract,\nthey have to fix it. They can't fob you off with 'that's a software\nproblem, talk to the software vendor.' etc.\n\n If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. There\nis then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc,\nthough some companies like RedHat don't maintain a sparc port anymore.\n\n You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK,\nwho do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux,\nthat has a few extras for their machines. Or, you can get a machine from a\ncheaper company like Dell, and it'll most likely work, most of the time.\n\nJohn\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n", 'subject': 'Re: [ILUG] Sun Solaris..'}
