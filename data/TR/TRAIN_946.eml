On http://lists.freshrpms.net/ the apt-list has been up\nfor a while now ;-) There is almost no traffic though, since I wanted to\nkeep that list for apt-rpm on the server side (mirrors, building\nrepositories etc.), but hey, it could be a good place for general apt-rpm\nquestions ;-)\n\nMatthias\n\n-- \nMatthias Saou                                World Trade Center\n-------------                                Edificio Norte 4 Planta\nSystem and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, Spain\nElectronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n", 'subject': 'Re: rpm-zzzlist@freshrpms.net'}
