If you need to such an expansion, you probably \nwant to do it in two passes, first doing a / to \\/ substitution on your \nreplacement strings, then inserting them into your final expression:\n\npata=`echo $1 | sed \'s,/,\\/,\'`\npatb=`echo $2 | sed \'s,/,\\/,\'`\nsed -e "s/PATTERN1/$pata/" -e "s/PATTERN2/$patb/" < input > output\n\nme\n', 'subject': 'Re: Bash script - pass command line arg to embedded sed script with\n multiple args'}
