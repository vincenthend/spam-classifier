Union is described in the Ritchie, Johnson, Lesk, and\r\nKernighan, The C Programming Language, in Bell System Technical\r\nJournal of JULY-AUGUST 1978, p. 1991. At that time the Bell System had\r\nC compilers running on PDP-11, Honeywell 6000, IBM System/370, and\r\nInterdata 8/32.  You\'re right. >20years.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nPaul E Condon           \r\npecondon@mesanetworks.net\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
