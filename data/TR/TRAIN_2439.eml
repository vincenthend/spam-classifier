See for instance :\nhttp://psyche.freshrpms.net/rpm.html?id=80\n\nWhere you can see :\nAvailable rpmbuild rebuild options :\n--with : alsa\n--without : aalib lirc libdv arts\n\nThe ogle package has also a --with alsa option, and I've had a bug report\nabout xine that I apparently unintentionally compiled with ALSA directly\n:-/\n\nI'd like to aks this on the rpm-zzzlist : Would a new dependency of 250k, the\nalsa-lib package, for many packages (mplayer, ogle, xine) be a problem for\nthe freshrpms.net packages users? As I really feel like blending ALSA in\nnow, especially since I've just spent some time recompiling alsa-kernel\npackage for all the Psyche kernels!!!\n\nMatthias\n\n-- \nMatthias Saou                                World Trade Center\n-------------                                Edificio Norte 4 Planta\nSystem and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, Spain\nElectronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n", 'subject': 'Re: ALSA Problem with Null kernel'}
