And you've also got to remember that volunteerism is not\r\nseen in the same way all over the world. We don't really have a board\r\nas such but we've given free membership to some individuals that have\r\nhelped out a lot in the past (current annual fee is AED150, around\r\n$40).\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nMagnus\r\n\r\n-- \r\nMagnus Nystedt\r\nwww.emiratesmac.com\r\nTwitter: twitter.com/mnystedt\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
