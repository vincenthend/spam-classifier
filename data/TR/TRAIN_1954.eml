Lenny?  Squeeze?  Sid?\n\nI\'ve experienced what you describe before, mainly because older releases\nof Debian used the lpr/lpd printing setup, and I used apsfilter to\ninstall printer drivers.  Then when I switched to a newer release of\nDebian that used CUPS, and foomatic did not have a driver for the printer,\nespecially for older or less popular printers.\n\nhttp://www.linuxprinting.org and http://www.cups.org are good places\nto start looking for documentation.\n\n-- \n  .\'\'`.
