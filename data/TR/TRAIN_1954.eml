Lenny?  Squeeze?  Sid?\r\n\r\nI\'ve experienced what you describe before, mainly because older releases\r\nof Debian used the lpr/lpd printing setup, and I used apsfilter to\r\ninstall printer drivers.  Then when I switched to a newer release of\r\nDebian that used CUPS, and foomatic did not have a driver for the printer,\r\nespecially for older or less popular printers.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linuxprinting.org and http://www.cups.org are good places\r\nto start looking for documentation.\r\n\r\n-- \r\n  .\'\'`.
