We\'re all on the same team.  I wish Alejandro would send an\nupdate.  I\'m kinda curious as to what was/is actually causing the problem.\n>From the very sparse info he provided, the cause could really be nearly\nanything.\n\nCome to think of it, has he even replied to any of our posts?  It doesn\'t\nlook like he has.  Seems that communication with the Cubans on debian-users\nis just plain spotty, whatever the reason.\n\nIf we don\'t hear back, I hope he got it working.\n\n-- \nStan\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
