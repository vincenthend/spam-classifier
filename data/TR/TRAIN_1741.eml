How\r\ncan you manage, e.g. in Iceweasel/FF, to use one or the other? If you\r\nhave multiple downloads all the time, it might be an interesting thing\r\nto split them among the diferent connections.\r\n\r\n--=20\r\nMerciadri Luca\r\nSee http://www.student.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/~merciadri/\r\nI use PGP. If there is an incompatibility problem with your mail\r\nclient, please contact me.\r\n\r\n\r\nListen to many, speak to a few.
