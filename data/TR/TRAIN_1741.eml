{'body': "Hi,\n\nLet's say that you have two internet connections at home, and\nconsequently two devices which link your computer to the Internet. How\ncan you manage, e.g. in Iceweasel/FF, to use one or the other? If you\nhave multiple downloads all the time, it might be an interesting thing\nto split them among the diferent connections.\n\n-- \nMerciadri Luca\nSee http://www.student.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/~merciadri/\nI use PGP. If there is an incompatibility problem with your mail\nclient, please contact me.\n\n\nListen to many, speak to a few.
