{'body': 'Hi,\n\nThe Wiki on dual channel memory says:\n\n"The memory modules are installed into matching banks, which are usually \ncolor coded on the motherboard. These separate channels allow each \nmemory module access to the memory controller, increasing throughput \nbandwidth."\n\nDoes that mean that placing 2 1GB modules, each into a different colored \nslot, is faster than putting 1 2GB module into one slot and leaving the \nother 3 slots empty?\n\nHugo\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
