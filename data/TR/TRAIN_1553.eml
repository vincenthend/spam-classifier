User Groups are designed to bring people together.\r\nWhen looking at "what\'s good for the members" and "what makes money",\r\na for profit venture would decide on money.  While I\'m sure it\r\nwouldn\'t do something "bad" to it\'s members, ultimately by it\'s\r\ndefinition it has to make a profit.  Nothing wrong with for profit\r\nventures, but to have someone volunteer in a for profit venture isn\'t\r\nreally volunteering.  It\'s giving of your time to make someone else\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nI think the FCP groups are great, but are in a different league on\r\nevery level than Apple User Groups.  They have more in common with\r\nMacworld and WWDC , IMHO\r\n\r\n\r\n>\r\n> Every group that I have seen take that attitude isn\'t around anymore, or =\r\nare\r\n> quite visibly killing themselves right now\r\n>\r\n>> Problem of course is, when you do what the members want, then you\r\n>> aren\'t leading. =A0Don\'t expect anything to change if you do what the\r\n>> existing members want. =A0You won\'t attract new members. =A0Eventually,\r\n>> though attrition, your group dies out. =A0You\'ll be paralyzed by the\r\n>> status quo\r\n>\r\n> Whilst I strongly advise all User Groups that they need to EVOLVE, they\r\n> don\'t need to be reactionary with changes. Evolution is a gradual change.\r\n\r\nI think, respectfully that\'s an excuse.  When groups still debate\r\nwhether to support classic users, then it\'s gone from gradual change\r\nto extinction.\r\n\r\n\r\n>\r\n>> Are printed newsletters and disks of the month emulating Apple\'s\r\n>> behavior? =A0Or is it acting like Microsoft that STILL allows you to run\r\n>> WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS on the newest and latest computers?\r\n>\r\n> There are still places for newsletters and Discs of the Month, even in th=\r\ne\r\n> 21st century... but again they need to be thought about differently... an=\r\nd\r\n> form part of an overall strategy of attracting the same sort of customers\r\n> that Apple themselves now target.\r\n>\r\n\r\nEnlighten me.  I simply can\'t imagine a scenario where the ancient\r\ndiscs of the month and printed newsletters make sense.  I know the\r\nargument:  "Our members wanted printed newsletters",  "They are on\r\ndialup and need these discs".  Is that leading?  Apple isn\'t targeting\r\npeople that don\'t have broadband internet connections.  They don\'t\r\neven make phone modems anymore.  Those were discontinued.  These\r\naren\'t customers Apple wants to support or attract.  They want these\r\ncustomers to enter the 21st century.\r\n\r\n> Then again, Apple itself isn\'t exactly democratic in the way it appoints\r\n> its\' own board.

I\'m a shareholder and get to vote on nominees.  I\r\nalways vote to remove Bill Campbell.  Intuit treats the Mac like a\r\nsecond class citizen.  Topic for a different day.  As a shareholder I\r\nalso get to go to the annual meeting, start shareholder initiatives\r\netc.  It\'s much more democratic than the way User Groups are run.\r\n\r\n>\r\n>> I hope this leads to an interesting and much needed discussion that is\r\n>> long overdue.\r\n>\r\n> hear, hear :)\r\n\r\nAlas, it would be nice if other voices join in.\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
