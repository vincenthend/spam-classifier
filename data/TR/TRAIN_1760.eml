People are just bigger dickheads now. Culture is changing\nand it is becoming acceptable to get in peoples face and shout them down\nwhen you disagree with them.  The people that do this are NOT\ndisenfranchised. They\nget their rocks off on being disagreeable assholes. The act of protesting is\nmore important than the actual issue being protested for most of these\npeople.\n\n> question the policy about terrorism, or drugs, or Iraq, or Bush in\n> general, you're aiding terrorism.

Shouting down speakers is an obviously stupid\ntactic if they are -really- interested in advocating change. Are they such\nclueless social morons that they don't see this or are they just interested\nin stroking their pathetic egos?\n\nOBTW, 'clueless social moron syndrom' does not have political boundaries.\n\nBill\n\n\n", 'subject': 'RE: Re[2]: A moment of silence for the First Amendment (fwd)'}
