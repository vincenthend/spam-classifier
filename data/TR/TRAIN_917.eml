Those spam\nmessages would get through any whitelist I set up (especially since I email\nstuff to myself all the time).  If whitelists become more popular, I\nimagine spammers will resort to doing that for the majority of their spams,\nmaking whitelists less helpful.\n\nPlus, I\'m still not sure how I feel about whitelists.  I don\'t think I\'m so\nspecial that people should need to fill out a special form just to send me\nemail.  I could see certain friends of mine getting fairly annoyed\n(especially those with multiple email addresses...).\n\n-Mike\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: Mossberg on \'ChoiceMail\': "In my tests, it cut my spam to zero."'}
