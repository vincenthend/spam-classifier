The design is a couple of generations later\n- more memory, less cruft, no *FSCKING* dos config utility, no jumpers on the\ncard and it's PCI.  \n\nRonan.\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n", 'subject': 'Re: [ILUG] Network problems'}
