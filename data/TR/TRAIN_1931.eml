(I did look at 2.5.1, too).\nAnd, I just did this off the top of my head (I wanted to see if it\n(**) still worked), so this is somewhat untested.\n\nAdding a menu entry is trivial; add this to your ~/.exmh/exmh-defaults:\n\n*Fops.more.m.uentrylist:\tketchup\n*Fops.more.m.l_ketchup:\t\tCatch-up all b4 cur\n*Fops.more.m.c_ketchup:\t \tMy_Mark2CurSeen\n\nThen you just need to provide the source for My_Mark2CurSeen and \narrange for Exmh to include it (put it in your ~/.tk/exmh directory\nin your user.tcl; or in pick.patch if you enable the "source hook"\nunder Prefs->Hacking Support)\n\nIt\'s going to look something like this:\n\nproc My_Mark2CurSeen {} {\n    global exmh pick msg\n    Exmh_Status "Clearing unseen up to cur..." red\n    Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msg(id)\n    set pick(ids) [...get message ids for "pick 1-cur"...]\n    busy PickMarkSeen\n    Exmh_Status ok blue\n}\n\n(that\'s based upon the guts of Pick_MarkSeen)\n\nYou need to fill in the code for the [...get...] section; I ran out of\ntime!\n\nJohn\n\n(*) "It just works" (tm)\n(**) "it" == my head\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: Minor feature request'}
