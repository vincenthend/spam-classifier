{'body': 'I\'ve had this binding in my ~/.exmh/exmhbindings for years:\n\nset {bindings(key,Flist_FindUnseen 1 ; Inc_PresortFinish)} <Key-f>\n\nAfter updating to the current code in CVS I get "bad key f" when \nI hit the "f" key.  I can open the Bindings... Commands window \nand define the binding.  It then works until I restart exmh.\n\nI suspect a parsing problem/change.  I\'ll try to look into this \ntomorrow unless someone knows where the problem might be.\n\n--Hal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Bindings problem with current CVS code'}
