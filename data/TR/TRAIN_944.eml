I had misinterpreted one of the Debian blog postings about 4.4.\r\nI see now that it is expected the next stable will ship with 4.4.4.  Has\r\nthere been any word about when 4.4.x will be moved to testing? I\'m\r\nreally hesitant to introduce all the libraries that will be dragged in\r\nif I install KDE from unstable into a production environment.  I even\r\nhesitate with testing but we are so desperate to make Kontact work with\r\nZimbra that we would take a chance - John\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
