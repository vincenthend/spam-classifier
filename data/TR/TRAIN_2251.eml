And if you\'re buying abroad, make sure you get\nto test it - many places won\'t have facilities for you to do that.\n\n> Question is: CAn I just plug in _any_ lcd monitor and expect it to work?  \n> Are there special incantations needed for XFree86 to work.

However, if you have the budget (insurance paying for the\ndead monitor, perhaps ? - and WHERE was your monitor that it got caught in a\nflood ?) getting a monitor with a DVI input is best. Of course, you\'ll need\na DVI out video card then, too. DVI provides a much better picture than VGA\nbecause it removes the analog stage - basically DVI gives you a direct\nconnection from video ram pixels to monitor pixels - the best pictures I\'ve\never seen on a computer is on my notebook screen at 1400x1050 (which doesn\'t\nuse DVI, but an internal connection which has the same effect). Brand wise,\nI like Iiyama a lot and I think they may have a Europe wide warranty.\n\n\n\nNiall\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users\' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: [ILUG] LCD monitors and linux'}
