So people who are installing this RPM and\nare unfortunate enough to have a DVD drive (or just an ordinary CD,\nnon-DVD drive) that doesn\'t support DMA will be left with a system\nwithout a working CD drive, even after removing the RPM.  And without\never knowing what struck them.  You can\'t remove the DMA setting from\nmodules.conf either unless you\'re sure that ogle added it there and\nnothing else needs it.\n\nThe /dev stuff isn\'t that dangerous, but the modules.conf change can\nbe.  That\'s why "Eek" :)\n\n> If someone installs ogle (a DVD player), I\'m assuming the hardware is\n> recent enough for software playback and that the drive is a DVD-ROM... all\n> of them support DMA!
