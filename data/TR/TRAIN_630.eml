{'body': 'When I make two "local" disks via MacFuse and I try to eject one of them the Finder insists on warning me that there are two drives on the same partition, and giving me the option to unmount all of them or just the one I tried to. This is very inconvenient for me.\n\nThe mount command shows:\n\n\nMyFS@fuse0 on /Volumes/MyFS_2Gig (...)\nMyFS@fuse1 on /Volumes/MyFS_4Gig (...)\n\nMy suspicion is that the Finder just looks for the mountFrom value then calls volumes partitions on the same disk if they only vary in the last number.\n\nThoughts?\n\nThanks,\nJim O\'Connor _______________________________________________\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
