{'body': 'When I make two "local" disks via MacFuse and I try to eject one of them =\r\nthe Finder insists on warning me that there are two drives on the same =\r\npartition, and giving me the option to unmount all of them or just the =\r\none I tried to. This is very inconvenient for me.\r\n\r\nThe mount command shows:\r\n\r\n\r\nMyFS@fuse0 on /Volumes/MyFS_2Gig (...)\r\nMyFS@fuse1 on /Volumes/MyFS_4Gig (...)\r\n\r\nMy suspicion is that the Finder just looks for the mount=46rom value =\r\nthen calls volumes partitions on the same disk if they only vary in the =\r\nlast number.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJim O\'Connor=\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
