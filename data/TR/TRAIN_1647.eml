PostgreSQL is for work; I don\'t get much choice about running that.\n\nI also have a history with MySQL and I *do* *not* *trust* it with my data.  \nUPS or not.  My email is fairly important for me -- I am probably in KMail \nonly slightly less than I am in a source code editor.  When I\'m testing or \ndeploying updates, I spend *more* time in KMail.\n\nYes.  I agree.  The kmail -> mysql-server dependency is not actually an "RC" \nbug, for Debian.\n\nIt is for me, but I run an exotic mixed system anyway, so I\'ll figure \n*something* out.\n-- \nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr.           \t ,= ,-_-. =.\nbss@iguanasuicide.net            \t((_/)o o(\\_))\nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy \t `-\'(. .)`-\'\nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/        \t     \\_/\n', 'subject': 'Re: KDE 4.4.3 in unstable'}
