{'body': 'Hello everybody,\n\nI have a problem with my sound card (nVidia Corporation MCP67 High\nDefinition Audio | ALC662 High Definition Audio) and I would like you to\nindicate the best location and the best way for me to report the bug that I\nwill describe:\n\nAfter a fresh installation and setup of alsa, I only have sound in one of\ntwo outputs and the microphone does not work. After reading a lot of\ndocumentation about the subject, I found that inserting the line "options\nsnd-hda-intel model = 3stack 6ch-index = 0" in alsa-base.conf file I can\nmake my sound card work better, but with some problems, which are:\n\na) If I select the 6-channel mode (in kmix or alsa-mixer), the two sound\noutputs work but the microphone do not work.\nb) If I select the 2-channel mode (in kmix or alsa-mixer), the microphone\nworks but only one sound output works.\n\nYou do not agree with me that this is a bug? I\'ve been experiencing it in\ndifferent distributions and several versions of the Linux kernel. As in\nseveral versions of ALSA.\n\nBefore you ask me, yes, I\'ve tried all the options associated with ALC662\ncodec (\nhttp://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/sound/alsa/HD-Audio-Models.txt)\nand the option mentioned above was that worked best.\n\n\n I am a novice user of Linux. So I ask you for help. How could I help solve\nthis problem? What is the right place to report this bug?\n\nThanks,\n\nMotherboard: ASUS M2N68-AM SE\nDebian Lenny\nSqueeze Debian / Sid\n\n\n\n\t<meta http-equiv="CONTENT-TYPE" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">\n\t<title></title>\n\t<meta name="GENERATOR" content="OpenOffice.org 3.2  (Linux)">\n\t<style type="text/css">\n\t<!--\n\t\t@page { margin: 0.79in }\n\t\tP { margin-bottom: 0.08in }\n\t-->\n\t</style>\n\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US">Hello everybody,<br><br>I\nhave a problem with my sound card (nVidia Corporation MCP67 High\nDefinition Audio | ALC662 High Definition Audio) and I would like you\nto indicate the best location and the best way for me to report the\nbug that I will describe:<br><br>After a fresh installation and setup\nof alsa, I only have sound in one of two outputs and the microphone\ndoes not work.
