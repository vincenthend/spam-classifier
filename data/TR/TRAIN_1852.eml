{'body': 'From nobody Fri Sep  7 01:04:42 2018\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1\n\nHello everybody,\r\n\r\nI have a problem with my sound card (nVidia Corporation MCP67 High\r\nDefinition Audio | ALC662 High Definition Audio) and I would like you to\r\nindicate the best location and the best way for me to report the bug that I\r\nwill describe:\r\n\r\nAfter a fresh installation and setup of alsa, I only have sound in one of\r\ntwo outputs and the microphone does not work. After reading a lot of\r\ndocumentation about the subject, I found that inserting the line "options\r\nsnd-hda-intel model = 3stack 6ch-index = 0" in alsa-base.conf file I can\r\nmake my sound card work better, but with some problems, which are:\r\n\r\na) If I select the 6-channel mode (in kmix or alsa-mixer), the two sound\r\noutputs work but the microphone do not work.\r\nb) If I select the 2-channel mode (in kmix or alsa-mixer), the microphone\r\nworks but only one sound output works.\r\n\r\nYou do not agree with me that this is a bug? I\'ve been experiencing it in\r\ndifferent distributions and several versions of the Linux kernel. As in\r\nseveral versions of ALSA.\r\n\r\nBefore you ask me, yes, I\'ve tried all the options associated with ALC662\r\ncodec (\r\nhttp://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/sound/alsa/HD-Audio-Models.txt)\r\nand the option mentioned above was that worked best.\r\n\r\n\r\n I am a novice user of Linux. So I ask you for help. How could I help solve\r\nthis problem? What is the right place to report this bug?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMotherboard: ASUS M2N68-AM SE\r\nDebian Lenny\r\nSqueeze Debian / Sid\r\n', 'subject': 'Problem with ALC662 Intel HDA'}
