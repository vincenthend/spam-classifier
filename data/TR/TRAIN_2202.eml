JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Inhaling diesel exhausts from large trucks and other\nsources over time can cause cancer in humans, an Environmental Protection\nAgency ( news - web sites) report concludes after a decade of study.\n\nThe EPA finding, released Tuesday, is expected to buttress the government\'s\npush to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleaner-burning engines\nand diesel fuel with ultra-low sulfur content.\n\nWhile acknowledging uncertainties about the long-term health effects of\nexposure to diesel exhausts, the EPA report said studies involving both\nanimal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancer\nrisk to humans.\n\n"It is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmental\nexposure levels" as well, the report said. "The potential human health\neffects of diesel exhausts is persuasive, even though assumptions and\nuncertainties are involved."\n\nThe report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from various\nworld health agencies and studies in California and is particularly\nsignificant because the EPA is the federal agency that regulates diesel\nemissions under the Clean Air Act.\n\nSome environmentalists have raised concerns recently that the Bush\nadministration might try to back away from a Clinton-era regulation that\nwould establish tougher requirements on emissions from large trucks and a\nseparate rule that virtually would eliminate sulfur from diesel fuel.\n\nEPA Administrator Christie Whitman repeatedly has promised to go ahead with\nthe tougher truck and diesel rules. Last month, with White House approval,\nthe EPA rebuffed attempts by some diesel engine manufacturers to postpone\nthe requirements, approving new penalties against manufacturers who fail to\nmeet an October deadline for making cleaner-burning truck engines.\n\nThe engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road,\nalthough the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel\nis expected to produce pollution reductions.\n\nThe EPA\'s 651-page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate the\nprobability of an individual getting cancer, given certain exposure to\ndiesel exhaust. Such a risk assessment is commonly made by the EPA when\ngauging pollution health concerns.\n\nBut in this case, the report said, "the exposure-response data are\nconsidered too uncertain" to produce a confident quantitative estimate of\ncancer risk to an individual.\n\nNevertheless, said the report, the "totality of evidence from human, animal\nand other supporting studies" suggests that diesel exhaust "is likely to be\ncarcinogenic to humans by inhalation, and that this hazard applies to\nenvironmental exposure."\n\nThe report reiterated that environmental exposure to diesel exhausts poses\nshort-term health problems and in the long term has been shown to be a\n"chronic respiratory hazard to humans" contributing to increased asthma and\nother respiratory problems. In some urban areas diesel exhausts account for\nas much as a quarter of the airborne microscopic soot, the report said.\n\nEnvironmentalists welcomed the study as clear evidence that pollution needs\nto be curtailed not only from large trucks but also from off-road\ndiesel-powered vehicles. EPA spokeswoman Steffanie Bell said the agency\nexpects to publish a rule early next year dealing with those diesel exhaust\nsources, which include farm tractors and construction equipment.\n\nEmily Figdor of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private\nenvironmental organization, said: "To reduce the public\'s exposure to\nharmful diesel emissions, the Bush administration should ... fully implement\nclean air standards for diesel trucks and buses and should pass equivalent\nstandards for diesel construction and farm equipment."\n\nAllen Schaeffer, executive director of the industry group Diesel Technology\nForum, said the EPA\'s report "focused on the past," whereas "the future is\nclean diesel. Diesel trucks and buses built today are more than eight times\ncleaner than just a dozen years ago."\n\nThe report acknowledged that its findings were based on emissions levels in\nthe mid-1990s, but said the results continued to be valid because the slow\nturnover of truck engines has kept many of these vehicles on the road.\n\n\n\n', 'subject': 'EPA Stunned: Diesel Exhaust Can Cause Cancer'}
