{'body': 'Hi, List!\n\nI have a few simple questions for you:\n\n1 - I there a better place to get help with dash\n2 - Is there way to detect that a script is running as dash, instead of a\nshell like Solaris\' /bin/sh\n3 - Corollary to #2, can I expect dash-as-sh to by a hard link or a sym\nlink?   (I would think not, but don\'t know Debian\'s policy here)\n4 - Reason for #2, is there a way to list all functions declared in a script\nwith dash?  Under Solaris\' shell, bash, or the korn shell I can use\n"typeset" -- I\'ve searched POSIX and don\'t see a way that doesn\'t involve\nparsing the script.\n\nThanks,\nWes\n\n-- \nWesley W.
