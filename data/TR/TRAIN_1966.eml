(I would think not, but don\'t know Debian\'s policy here)\r\n4 - Reason for #2, is there a way to list all functions declared in a script\r\nwith dash?  Under Solaris\' shell, bash, or the korn shell I can use\r\n"typeset" -- I\'ve searched POSIX and don\'t see a way that doesn\'t involve\r\nparsing the script.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nWes\r\n\r\n-- \r\nWesley W.
