One of those has 864\nof such capacitors and stores only 10 megajoules, which means 11 kilojoules\neach.  They weigh 125 kg.\n\nYou need high energy per unit mass, and the capacitive system I picked\nmaximizes that.\n\nIt is precisely the system that Maxwell is touting for electrical braking\nand power augmentation for regenerative use in automobiles.  You also need\nvoltage you can use in a DC motor, which is why though the actual\ncapacitors in the system are charged to 2.5 volts, the system has them\narranged in series to boost the voltage.\n\nIgnore him.  He\'s a waste of my time.\n\n\n<Somebody\'s .sig>\n------------------------\n  From: "R. A.

That must be why 40kV is standard not 42.\n(the joke of putting 42 into goggle to find that model was not missed BTW)\n\nMost production systems use a mix of batteries and capacitors, as very few\nreal world applications run for less then 10 seconds like the car we were\ntalking about originally. Even 10 seconds is pushing the "capactior is the\nwrong choice" limits. Thats why the landspeed record model is a battery one,\nit\'s got to run for a much longer period of time and needs a steady\ndischarge curve.\n\nBut it should be safe to say that most people want the Indy 500 version, not\nthe 1/4 mile sprint version when they are looking for a vehice :) For those\nyou dont want a battery or a capacitor, you want to take advantage of whole\natoms, not just electrons. Then you can suck off the electrons you need with\na fuel cell. However, you will use both capacitors for the braking/accel,\nand batteries to not just dump excess energy in the design.\n\n- Adam L.
