So, you need to define them in your\n.m file (not as part of your class @interface), and keep in mind that\nthey won't be visible from category methods that are defined in a\ndifferent .m file.\n\nsherm--\n\n-- \nCocoa programming in Perl:\nhttp://www.camelbones.org\n _______________________________________________\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
