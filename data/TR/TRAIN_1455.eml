{'body': 'Hi all,\r\n\r\nwith respect to my problem that the video callback is triggered more =\r\noften than I want to (see below) I had a guess that it is related to the =\r\ndevice frame rate. In that context I tried to set the frame rate of my =\r\ninbuilt iSight to 1 and SGGetFrameRate did confirm this:=20\r\n\r\n  err =3D SGSetFrameRate(videoData->sgchanVideo,IntToFixed(1));\r\n  Fixed *frameRate;\r\n  SGGetFrameRate(videoData->sgchanVideo,frameRate);\r\n  int rate =3D FixedToInt(*frameRate);\r\n  cout << "FrameRate: " << rate << endl;  //// PLOTS 1 WHEN EXECUTING\r\n\r\nHowever, when I execute the app the frame size is much higher (I guess =\r\n30 fps or more). I saw an older post from 2007, which dealt with the =\r\nsame problem of not being able to set the inbuilt iChat frame rate but =\r\nnobody replied. Does anyone have a guess how to approach this problem ?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\n-- A l e x\r\n\r\n\r\n***********************************\r\nHi all,\r\n\r\nI have a thread, which triggers the SGIdle call according to my desired =\r\nframe rate:\r\n\r\nvoid video::run(){\r\n while (running){\r\n   sj->dFC->videoBlocker->lock();\r\n   sj->dFC->videoWaiter->wait(sj->dFC->videoBlocker);\r\n\r\n   err =3D SGIdle(videoData->seqGrab);\r\n   usleep(1000000/1);   //// FRAMERATE\r\n\r\n   sj->dFC->videoBlocker->unlock();\r\n }\r\n}\r\n\r\nIn this example the thread waits for 1 second before executing the next =\r\ntime, which results in a frame rate of 1 fps. However, I discovered some =\r\n strange system behavior, which forced me to verify if this is really =\r\nthe case: I applied a time measurement between each data proc function =\r\ncall and in fact it is executed 4 more times ins between in approx. 250 =\r\nmicrosecond intervals. In the following I have plotted the measured =\r\ninterval times in ms:\r\n\r\n1000.38\r\n0.026\r\n0.023\r\n0.024\r\n0.027\r\n1002.55\r\n0.025\r\n0.026\r\n0.022\r\n0.021\r\n1002.61\r\n0.026\r\n0.021\r\n0.02\r\n0.024\r\n1002.54\r\n0.026\r\n0.023\r\n0.024\r\n0.02\r\n1000.18\r\n0.026\r\n0.137\r\n0.025\r\n0.024\r\n\r\netc .... and so forth. This is actually not happening when I reside =\r\nabove a framerate of 25 fps. Can anyone tell me why this is happening =\r\nand how I can prevent this to happen ?=20\r\n\r\nThanks a lot in advance, best\r\n\r\n-- A l e x\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
