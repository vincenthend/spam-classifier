{'body': 'Hi all,\n\nwith respect to my problem that the video callback is triggered more often than I want to (see below) I had a guess that it is related to the device frame rate. In that context I tried to set the frame rate of my inbuilt iSight to 1 and SGGetFrameRate did confirm this: \n\n  err = SGSetFrameRate(videoData->sgchanVideo,IntToFixed(1));\n  Fixed *frameRate;\n  SGGetFrameRate(videoData->sgchanVideo,frameRate);\n  int rate = FixedToInt(*frameRate);\n  cout << "FrameRate: " << rate << endl;  //// PLOTS 1 WHEN EXECUTING\n\nHowever, when I execute the app the frame size is much higher (I guess 30 fps or more). I saw an older post from 2007, which dealt with the same problem of not being able to set the inbuilt iChat frame rate but nobody replied. Does anyone have a guess how to approach this problem ?\n\nThanks in advance\n\n-- A l e x\n\n\n***********************************\nHi all,\n\nI have a thread, which triggers the SGIdle call according to my desired frame rate:\n\nvoid video::run(){\n while (running){\n   sj->dFC->videoBlocker->lock();\n   sj->dFC->videoWaiter->wait(sj->dFC->videoBlocker);\n\n   err = SGIdle(videoData->seqGrab);\n   usleep(1000000/1);   //// FRAMERATE\n\n   sj->dFC->videoBlocker->unlock();\n }\n}\n\nIn this example the thread waits for 1 second before executing the next time, which results in a frame rate of 1 fps. However, I discovered some  strange system behavior, which forced me to verify if this is really the case: I applied a time measurement between each data proc function call and in fact it is executed 4 more times ins between in approx. 250 microsecond intervals. In the following I have plotted the measured interval times in ms:\n\n1000.38\n0.026\n0.023\n0.024\n0.027\n1002.55\n0.025\n0.026\n0.022\n0.021\n1002.61\n0.026\n0.021\n0.02\n0.024\n1002.54\n0.026\n0.023\n0.024\n0.02\n1000.18\n0.026\n0.137\n0.025\n0.024\n\netc .... and so forth. This is actually not happening when I reside above a framerate of 25 fps. Can anyone tell me why this is happening and how I can prevent this to happen ? \n\nThanks a lot in advance, best\n\n-- A l e x\n _______________________________________________\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
