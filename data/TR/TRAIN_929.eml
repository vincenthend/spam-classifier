{'body': "On my white MacBook (2007 eta) that I recently upgraded from Leopard  \nto Snow Leopard. I have installed all current updates.\n\nNow, and not before, I notice that frequently when I start to re-use  \nthe machine that it has zero brightness when it powers up. The  \n'increase brightness' control has no effect (but other keys do work).  \nIf I close the lid but then reopen it before the machine goes to sleep  \nthat usually does the trick and I have medium(ish) brightness and can  \nturn brightness up or down.\n\nI am testing if this is related to X11/Xquartz so thought I would ask  \nhere if anybody else has experience this problem.\n\nI can provide more h/w details later.\n\nThanks, M\n\n\nDr. Michael K Bane\nSenior Development Officer\nRESEARCH COMPUTING SERVICES\nDevonshire House\nPrecinct Centre\nThe University of Manchester\nManchester\nM13 9PL\n\nwww.rcs.manchester.ac.uk\nwww.twitter.com/mkbane_mcr\nwww.facebook.com/group.php?gid=73597922129\n\n _______________________________________________\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
