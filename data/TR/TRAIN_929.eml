{'body': "On my white MacBook (2007 eta) that I recently upgraded from Leopard  \r\nto Snow Leopard. I have installed all current updates.\r\n\r\nNow, and not before, I notice that frequently when I start to re-use  \r\nthe machine that it has zero brightness when it powers up. The  \r\n'increase brightness' control has no effect (but other keys do work).  \r\nIf I close the lid but then reopen it before the machine goes to sleep  \r\nthat usually does the trick and I have medium(ish) brightness and can  \r\nturn brightness up or down.\r\n\r\nI am testing if this is related to X11/Xquartz so thought I would ask  \r\nhere if anybody else has experience this problem.\r\n\r\nI can provide more h/w details later.\r\n\r\nThanks, M\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Michael K Bane\r\nSenior Development Officer\r\nRESEARCH COMPUTING SERVICES\r\nDevonshire House\r\nPrecinct Centre\r\nThe University of Manchester\r\nManchester\r\nM13 9PL\r\n\r\nwww.rcs.manchester.ac.uk\r\nwww.twitter.com/mkbane_mcr\r\nwww.facebook.com/group.php?gid=73597922129\r\n\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
