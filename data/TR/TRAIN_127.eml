{'body': '\nI recently brought up a new system - SuSe 7.3 and I am running\nspamassassin and procmail, which work fine.\n\nI tried bringing up razor (2.14) but I am not able to get the SDK to\ninstall and razor reports missing modules. They appear to be there. I\nfollowed the installation directions. There appears to be an endless list\nof errors. Any ideas on what to do or where to start?\n\nDoug\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nRazor-users mailing list\nRazor-users@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-users\n\n\n', 'subject': '[Razor-users] Problem with SDK 2.03?'}
