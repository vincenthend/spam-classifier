Of course, this would still \nmean that "The U.N. is going to invade America!" spams with SWE would get \nthrough.  Probably also need to ignore SWE in messages that look like \nNigerian scams.\n\n-- \nGive a man a match, and he\'ll be warm for a minute, but set him on\nfire, and he\'ll be warm for the rest of his life.\n\nICQ: 132152059 | Advanced SPAM filtering software: http://spamassassin.org\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: Jabber - The world\'s fastest growing \nreal-time communications platform!
