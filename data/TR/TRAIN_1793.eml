{'body': 'This is due to insufficient write privileges to the "razor-agent.log" \nfile. A quick work-around is to do a "chmod go+rx" on that file (of \ncourse, it\'s better to restrict the access as much as possible).\n\nIn Agent.pm, when the Razor2::Logger object is created, if it doesn\'t \nhave write permission to the log file it does not succeed. Then, later \nin the code when the log object is used, it fails with the "unblessed" \nerror.\n\nHope this helps,\nMichael Duff\n\nDavid Rees wrote:\n\n>This is my first time running Razor, heard a lot of good things about it so\n>I thought I\'d give it a shot.
