Bundle is limited to bare minimum (esata/usb \nbracket and a few cables). Used for video processing mainly, occasional \nkernel compilations, virtualbox vm and the occasional game.Works with \nSqueeze amd64 with stock kernel (minor sound glitches with on-board \nchip) and currently 2.6.33.2 (100% functional), suspend works too.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
