Bundle is limited to bare minimum (esata/usb \r\nbracket and a few cables). Used for video processing mainly, occasional \r\nkernel compilations, virtualbox vm and the occasional game.Works with \r\nSqueeze amd64 with stock kernel (minor sound glitches with on-board \r\nchip) and currently 2.6.33.2 (100% functional), suspend works too.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
