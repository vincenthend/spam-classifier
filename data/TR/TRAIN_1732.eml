{'body': '-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\nHash: SHA1\n\nA website I want to use would allow access unless my java applet is JRE\n6 update 13 or higher.  As far as I can figure out the applet provided\nby package sun-java6-bin is update 12.\n\n- From the Sun Microsystems site I downloaded file jre-6u19-i586.bin;\nmoved it to directory /usr/lib/jvm, changed ownership to root:root and\npermissions to rwxr-xr-x and ran the binary.  It created a new directory\n/usr/lib/jvm/jre1.6.0_19 and opened in that directory a number of\nsubdirectories and files.\n\nNext, I needed to add this new JRE to /etc/alternatives.  Using the\nalternatives configurator provided by package galternatives, as root I\nselected \'java\' as the alternative to configure and added to the options\nlist /usr/lib/jvm/1.6.0_19/bin/java and finally selected this new option.\n\nAfter reloading Iceweasel, about:plugins still showed the previous JRE I\nwas using, /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/bin/java.\n\nAssuming that I can use a later version of JRE downloaded from Sun on\nIceweasel 3.5, am I on the right track but did not get the newer version\nset up correctly, or is there a different way?\n\nKen Heard\n\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v2.0.9 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niEYEARECAAYFAkvEzi8ACgkQlNlJzOkJmTc8GwCfSO/C8Xip3eo02hMLm2LbUMxB\n43gAn1fgJ6lPRotxSt5Oh30hnVduQzkp\n=pYRX\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
