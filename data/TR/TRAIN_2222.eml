{'body': 'Mike,\n\nThanks for explaining this, and clarifying the situation.\n\nI can report that I indeed did not have sufficient privileges.

Please see bug id\n8017275.\n\nThanks for your help,\n\nRob\n\nOn Sat, May 22, 2010 at 5:18 PM, Mike Swingler <swingler@apple.com> wrote:\n> On May 21, 2010, at 12:04 PM, Rob Dickens wrote:\n>\n>> Mike,\n>>\n>> Thanks for responding, and explaining what causes the flickering.\n>>\n>>> If your MacBook is actually 32-bit only, you should never even see the 64-bit JVMs.\n>>\n>> And I don\'t.
