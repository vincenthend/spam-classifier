Recently, in private email, \nErnest Miller claimed that doing so would be a violation of the DMCA. In this \nin-depth special report, I show that using perfectly legal, (I assume) \nlicensed, off-the-shelf consumer software, copying DVDs is easy and in many \nways encouraged. \n\n*Tools:*\n1 PowerBook G4 with slot-loading DVD drive (any model should work)\n1 Monsters, Inc. Collector\'s Edition DVD (any DVD should work)\n1 copy of Mac OS X 10.2 "Jaguar" \n\n*Process:*\n1. Insert DVD into drive. Notice how Jaguar helpfully loads the DVD Player for \nyou.\n2. Open the DVD (it appears on the desktop) and drag the VIDEO_TS folder to \nyour hard drive. Ejct the DVD.\n3. In DVD Player, select "Open VIDEO_TS Folder..." from the File menu. Use the \ndialog that appears to select the VIDEO_TS folder on your hard drive. \n\nNow the DVD plays just like it would were the DVD in the drive. By extension, I \ncould also put the DVD up on my site for you to download and watch. I could \nshare it via a P2P network. And I haven\'t done anything to decrypt the DVD or \nviolate the DMCA: I\'ve used only basic tools available to all normal computer \nusers on my (I assume) fully-licensed consumer laptop. \n\n*Disclaimer:* Seth Schoen, whose opinion I highly respect on these matters, \nfinds it unlikely that the DVD was CSS-encrypted if this was possible. I am not \nsure how to verify if the DVD is CSS-encrypted. If someone has a suggestion, \nplease let me know. However, if it is true, then it\'s very interesting that \nDisney has released such a major movie without encryption.\n\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Apple: Heinous DVD Pirates'}
