But it works on console.\n\nOn GNOME yes, users can mount/umount their own usb devices via Nautilus.\n\n> On a debian testing PC i\'d like to have some automatic action after\n> inserting my GPS device in the USB slot.

A quick example, courtesy of Google:\n\nhttp://www.gradstein.info/hardware/how-to-automatically-run-a-script-after-inserting-a-usb-device-on-ubuntu/\n\n> Should i use /media to mount the USB device, or is /media reserved for \n> the system?\n\nYou can use /media, and as Boyd already suggested, give the device a \nlabel to get a static name so it always get mounted under the \nsame path, i.e., "/media/mygps".\n\nGreetings,\n\n-- \nCamalen\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
