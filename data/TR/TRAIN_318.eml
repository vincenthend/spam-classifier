But it works on console.\r\n\r\nOn GNOME yes, users can mount/umount their own usb devices via Nautilus.\r\n\r\n> On a debian testing PC i\'d like to have some automatic action after\r\n> inserting my GPS device in the USB slot.

A quick example, courtesy of Google:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gradstein.info/hardware/how-to-automatically-run-a-script-after-inserting-a-usb-device-on-ubuntu/\r\n\r\n> Should i use /media to mount the USB device, or is /media reserved for \r\n> the system?\r\n\r\nYou can use /media, and as Boyd already suggested, give the device a \r\nlabel to get a static name so it always get mounted under the \r\nsame path, i.e., "/media/mygps".\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\n\r\n-- \r\nCamale\xc3\xb3n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
