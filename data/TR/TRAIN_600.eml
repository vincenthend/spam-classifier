After a bit of climbing up and\r\nfalling down, the answer has shown.\r\nIf the question is: what is an alternative to firefox,\r\nI could say: conkeror. Depends on libxul. Almost the\r\nsame look and feel, but no tables nor bars. I recompiled\r\nfrom the source both lib and the browser. I assume for\r\ndebian already may be found the binary file.\r\nIf I missed the point, sorry.\r\n\r\n                           Zoran\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
