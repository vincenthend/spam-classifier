Ours died a week\nor so ago and due to doing some research we will nto be getting anysuch\ndevice in the near or far future. I mean even if one half of the crap it\nis reported to do is true it s just not worth it for a quick cup or warm\nchai.\n\nWhich brings me to the fact that finding a good Convection only (not combo\nwith a microwaver) oven of any good size is dang near impossible unless\nyou go up to the bizness sizes. thankfully there is Dehlongi of which\ncostco has thru thier online store.\n\nNow of course the question is do we get it delivered to the old house or\nthe new one (yep we got our offer approved and are in the short run down\nto a long mortage:)  we close on oct 31. though the realestate agent says\nt happens like that a lot, I still find it incrediably jolting to have\nfound a house inthe hood I want with the space dawn wants on sunday and we\nare signing papers on tuesday night with a close at the end of the month.\n\nWhich of course means....wifi land for wsmf:)- )\n\nSo far I like the Linksys dsl/cable router all in one wifi ap. The Dlink\nhas the funky 22mb stuff IF you use all thier stuff across the net and the\nway things go I cant say thats gonna happen for sure. Pluse the Linksys\nstuff is all over the mass market sotres so I cna walk home with parts at\nany time.\n\nThe fun now comes with a realization that with ATTbi cable as my main hose\ntot he net offering up bwf might be a tad problematic....So i am thinking\nof ways around/through/under that. the setup of the particualrs are far\nform set in stone...any ideas would be welcome.\n\nAlso any portlanders.....party time.\n\n\n-tom\n\n\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: Wifi query'}
