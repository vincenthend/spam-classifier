I mean, how to keep debian as updated as, say, ubuntu or even sidux?? You know, latest iceweasel, openoffice, gnome, etc. Maybe using unstable or experimental repo? I\'m sure there\'s many ways to do this, but I just don\'t know.. I\'m new to debian :(\n>\n> Thanks a lot,\n> RJB\n>\n>\n>    \nRun sidux.  It is Debian unstable with some people doing some extra work \nto keep it a bit more stable for you.  Use the smxi script which helps \nkeep things stable also (and simplifies installation of some software to \nboot).  I love sidux on the desktop (and vanilla Debian on my servers).\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf the master dies and the disciple grieves, the lives of both have\nbeen wasted.\n\nSaturday May 15, 2010\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
