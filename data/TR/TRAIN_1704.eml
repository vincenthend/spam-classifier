Adding a "spam" header makes sense given the convention.\n\nI\'d suggest using Precedence: junk. Albeit it\'s no standard header does most \nSoftware already recognize it. Courier eg. doesn\'t send auto-replies to \nmails with the Precedence bulk or junk. I think Outlook does handle these \nspecial, too.
