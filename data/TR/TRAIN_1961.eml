This causes some =\r\ntools like Java VisualVM to fail, because it\'s bundle will contain a =\r\nhodgepodge of GM and DP bits, and the GM installer doesn\'t know to =\r\nremove the DP bits (because when it was created, the DP bits we not =\r\ninvented yet).\r\n\r\nThis should be enough to test the 1.6.0_17 JVM, but this is hardly a =\r\n"valid" configuration. Installing the 10M3044/9M3144 DP again on top of =\r\nthis mixed mess _should_ clean up the GM bits and put you into a valid =\r\nDP configuration. Probably. Most likely.\r\n\r\nIf things get too out of control, you should always be able to move =\r\naside the /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions =\r\ndirectory, and re-run either the GM or DP installer, and you should get =\r\na fully coherent Java installation (modulo the tools in /usr/share/java =\r\nand a other few exceptions in /System/Library which don\'t really change =\r\nbetween versions).\r\n\r\nBest of luck,\r\nMike Swingler\r\nJava Runtime Engineer\r\nApple Inc.=\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
