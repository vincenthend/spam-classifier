This causes some tools like Java VisualVM to fail, because it\'s bundle will contain a hodgepodge of GM and DP bits, and the GM installer doesn\'t know to remove the DP bits (because when it was created, the DP bits we not invented yet).\n\nThis should be enough to test the 1.6.0_17 JVM, but this is hardly a "valid" configuration. Installing the 10M3044/9M3144 DP again on top of this mixed mess _should_ clean up the GM bits and put you into a valid DP configuration. Probably. Most likely.\n\nIf things get too out of control, you should always be able to move aside the /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions directory, and re-run either the GM or DP installer, and you should get a fully coherent Java installation (modulo the tools in /usr/share/java and a other few exceptions in /System/Library which don\'t really change between versions).\n\nBest of luck,\nMike Swingler\nJava Runtime Engineer\nApple Inc. _______________________________________________\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
