{'body': 'This is my first time running Razor, heard a lot of good things about it so\nI thought I\'d give it a shot.  I also run SpamAssassin so I\'d like to\nintegrate the two.\n\nI\'m not sure if this problem is with SpamAssassin or Razor, so I though I\'d\nshoot the message here first\n\nWith a freshly installed SpamAssassin 2.41 and Razor 2.14 I\'m seeing these\nmessages spit out from spamd:\n\nrazor2 check skipped: No such file or directory Can\'t call method "log" on\nunblessed reference at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/Razor2/Client/Agent.pm\nline 211, <STDIN> line 75.\n\nAny ideas?  razor seems to run correctly over the command line.\n\nThanks,\n-Dave\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old\ncell phone?
