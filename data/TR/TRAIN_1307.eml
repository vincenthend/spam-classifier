I had this since KDE 4.4.0 (self-compiled) and\r\nit vanished when switching from the 4.4.2 debs to the 4.4.3 ones.\r\nSo I thought it was just fixed for 4.4.3. Now I wonder what I did to\r\nmake it work.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-kde-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe". Trouble?
