All you need is a machine configured to boot from CD-ROM and use \na RAM disk for scratch space. Numerous Linux distros are available that \nlet you boot a stateless but functional system from CD-ROM.\n\n> Obviously, you can\'t do this with partitions that accrue important \n> state, e.g. a partition that stores database table data.\n\n... but if you *do* want some state to persist, then you need a \nmountable writable partition. To protect it, you need some kind of \naccess control management to decide who can do what to the writable \npartition, blah blah blah ... and before you know it, the security \nproblem starts to look just like it does for conventional servers.\n\nSimple approxmation to this: make /usr a separate partion, and mount it \nread-only:\n\n    * The good news: attackers that want to trojan your software have to\n      reboot, at least.\n    * The bad news: administrators that want to update your software\n      have to reboot, at least.\n\nCrispin\n\n-- \nCrispin Cowan, Ph.D.\nChief Scientist, WireX                      http://wirex.com/~crispin/\nSecurity Hardened Linux Distribution:       http://immunix.org\nAvailable for purchase: http://wirex.com/Products/Immunix/purchase.html\n\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: use of base image / delta image for automated recovery from\n    attacks'}
