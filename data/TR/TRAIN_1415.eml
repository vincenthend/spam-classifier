{'body': "From nobody Fri Sep  7 01:04:40 2018\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1\n\nFirst of all, I am very new to Linux but am well aware of the need to\r\nlearn.  After considerable googling with my issue, I gave up and thought I'd\r\ntry a mailing list instead :)\r\n\r\nIn attempting to install the cvm package (apt-get install cvm), I recieve a\r\nwarning indicating that the XDM service cannot be automatically\r\nstopped/started and that I should do so manually.\r\n\r\nI then use rcconf to remove the little dot-selector-thingy beside XDM,\r\nwhich, as far as I understand, should stop the service immediately, but\r\nerrors ensue in the rest of the installation and when I continue the\r\ninstallation again (apt-get -f install) I recieve the same warning that XDM\r\nis running and needs to be stopped manually.  Checking in rcconf, the\r\nservice is already unselected.  Taking a hint from my background with MS\r\nWindows, I restarted the computer and tried the installation again; same\r\nwarning and rcconf still shows the service as unselected.\r\n\r\nWhat am I not understanding here?  Thanks in advance!\r\nTom Schlodder - Calgary, Alberta, Canada\r\n", 'subject': 'Cannot stop XDM service'}
