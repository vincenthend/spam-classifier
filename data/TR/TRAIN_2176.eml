M. Henning escribió:\n\n> We are Mac@LehighValley or M@LV.  The Lehigh Valley is aka Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, PA.\n> \n> We are a diverse group with retirees, computer professionals, other professionals, educators, and some children that come with there parents.  We meet in a nursing home but no one from the nursing home is a member.  One member does volunteer work there.  Our meeting place is in a dining area with WiFi/Airport available.  We are very fortunate to be near Dave Marra, Apple Senior Systems Engineer, who is a speaker at many MUGs including ours.\n> \n> Our meetings involve both member presentation and invited guests.  We always try to answer questions and solve problems.  We have a local Apple Store that has been absolutely zero help except some of our members always have the latest gizmos, like iPads, the day they are introduced.  We also have several Apple vendors and an Apple third party manufacturer in the area.  They are much more of a help.\n> \n> Since we don't have any major common interests except Mac/Apple, we normally stick with Apple software and low-cost or no-cost third party software.  We don't do many programs on Adobe products but do some on Microsoft products.  Some members are into other Unix systems such as Linux and open-source software.\n> \n> Our president is a Graphic Designer so our newsletter is always a real treat.\n> \n> We draw members from quite a distance since we are about all there is is Southeast Pennsylvania outside the Philadelphia area.\n> \n> Cheers, Steve Henning, Membership Director, Apple Ambassador, Webmaster\n> \n> Mac@LehighValley Users Group\n> http://www.MacAtLehighValley.org\n> \n> _______________________________________________\n> Do not post admin requests to the list.
