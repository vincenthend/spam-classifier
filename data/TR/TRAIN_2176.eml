M. Henning escribi=F3:\r\n\r\n> We are Mac@LehighValley or M@LV.  The Lehigh Valley is aka =\r\nAllentown-Bethlehem-Easton, PA.\r\n>=20\r\n> We are a diverse group with retirees, computer professionals, other =\r\nprofessionals, educators, and some children that come with there =\r\nparents.  We meet in a nursing home but no one from the nursing home is =\r\na member.  One member does volunteer work there.  Our meeting place is =\r\nin a dining area with WiFi/Airport available.  We are very fortunate to =\r\nbe near Dave Marra, Apple Senior Systems Engineer, who is a speaker at =\r\nmany MUGs including ours.\r\n>=20\r\n> Our meetings involve both member presentation and invited guests.  We =\r\nalways try to answer questions and solve problems.  We have a local =\r\nApple Store that has been absolutely zero help except some of our =\r\nmembers always have the latest gizmos, like iPads, the day they are =\r\nintroduced.  We also have several Apple vendors and an Apple third party =\r\nmanufacturer in the area.  They are much more of a help.\r\n>=20\r\n> Since we don't have any major common interests except Mac/Apple, we =\r\nnormally stick with Apple software and low-cost or no-cost third party =\r\nsoftware.  We don't do many programs on Adobe products but do some on =\r\nMicrosoft products.  Some members are into other Unix systems such as =\r\nLinux and open-source software.\r\n>=20\r\n> Our president is a Graphic Designer so our newsletter is always a real =\r\ntreat.\r\n>=20\r\n> We draw members from quite a distance since we are about all there is =\r\nis Southeast Pennsylvania outside the Philadelphia area.\r\n>=20\r\n> Cheers, Steve Henning, Membership Director, Apple Ambassador, =\r\nWebmaster\r\n>=20\r\n> Mac@LehighValley Users Group\r\n> http://www.MacAtLehighValley.org\r\n>=20\r\n> _______________________________________________\r\n> Do not post admin requests to the list.
