So, I immediately wrote\r\nher at her email address and alerted her that the FaceBook\r\naccount had been compromised. A day later she wrote:\r\n\r\n   > I have been told by our IS department that this is a\r\n   >  very bad worm.  If you were also hijacked be sure to monitor\r\n   >  your credit card and banking accounts regularly.\r\n   >  Never click on any links in the future.
