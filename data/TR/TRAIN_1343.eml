Doing stuff coordinating with a whole distro,\r\nwhithin ugly hacks and with a good ending quality, is not.\r\n\r\nBTW, I would rather advise people learn how to build their own packages before\r\nusing and thus depending in this 3rd party repo, no only because security reasons, \r\nor because it is not built in the top of debian.  This repo is not going to be \r\nthere forever, for sure, sooner or later people maintaining it will get tired, \r\nand if you are planning to use KDE 3 forever...\r\n\r\nJust pointing about this to people mentioning this repo, nothing direclty to\r\nMartin here :)\r\n\r\nAna\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-kde-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
