Just go turn them off.\r\n\r\nBut I have to _look_ at them to turn them off.  In KDE 3 I do not.

I cannot help when you evade the question.\r\n\r\nI have not evaded the question.  I have pointed out that I prefer things th=\r\nat=20\r\nare functional to things that are showy.  As I stated at the beginning.  As=\r\n=20\r\nsomeone else has pointed out, KDE 4 has had 2 years to become half way=20\r\nbearable and has signally failed.  I mourn the passing of KDE 3.5.x, which =\r\nI=20\r\nregard as the pinnacle of DE\'s.  In other words, we have come full circle a=\r\nnd=20\r\nare back at the beginning.  You have to learn to accept that not everyone=20\r\nagrees with you.\r\n\r\nAnd, I fear that the lengths you are going to to try and persuade me that I=\r\n am=20\r\nwrong, even to the extent of telling me that I am only allowed to be made i=\r\nll=20\r\nby something that also makes your mother ill, do not strike me as helping m=\r\ne.\r\n\r\nLisi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=2D------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
