Just go turn them off.\n\nBut I have to _look_ at them to turn them off.  In KDE 3 I do not.  I can turn \nthem off without ever having to see them.\n\n> And\n> the defaults do not have wobbly windows, wavy effects, or anything\n> shimmering.

They make me feel sick and trigger \na bad headache.\n\n> > 2. ctrl+tab does not move to the next window.\n>\n> Do you mean between tabs?

That is how I open all my applications.\n\nThey do not.  They are much more complicated than in KDE 3 and you have to \ntype more to be offered anything.\n\n> > 4.

Alt+F5, which I also like and use a lot, brings \nup a list of running windows.\n\n> > 5.

I cannot help when you evade the question.\n\nI have not evaded the question.  I have pointed out that I prefer things that \nare functional to things that are showy.  As I stated at the beginning.  As \nsomeone else has pointed out, KDE 4 has had 2 years to become half way \nbearable and has signally failed.  I mourn the passing of KDE 3.5.x, which I \nregard as the pinnacle of DE\'s.  In other words, we have come full circle and \nare back at the beginning.  You have to learn to accept that not everyone \nagrees with you.\n\nAnd, I fear that the lengths you are going to to try and persuade me that I am \nwrong, even to the extent of telling me that I am only allowed to be made ill \nby something that also makes your mother ill, do not strike me as helping me.\n\nLisi\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
