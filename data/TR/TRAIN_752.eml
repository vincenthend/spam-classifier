United Airlines\' parent\ncompany\'s stock sank on speculation that UAL is next in line for \nChapter 11. It\'s a wonder none of this happened last September,\nbut it\'s not much consolation to airline employees,\nshareholders, and customers that it\'s happening now.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal had the most extensive coverage of\nAmerican\'s plan as of Unspun\'s deadline. The airline will lay\noff 7,000 workers, ground some jets, cut back on flight\namenities such as food, and retool its hub operations to make\nfor longer layovers. "In the past, airlines were loath to have\nlonger connection times because flights were listed in travel\nagents\' computers by elapsed time," said the Journal. "Now,\nonline booking tools and search engines most often list flights\nby price, not time." In this age of penny-pinching, American\'s\nworried about low-cost carriers, not the big guys like, um, US\nAir and United. \n\nSpeaking of United, it\'s hard to come up with a verb for its\nparent company\'s stock that doesn\'t invoke an air disaster.\nLet\'s just say it didn\'t go up yesterday. The $3.80 share price\nmay be the least of UAL\'s worries while it waits for an\nincreasingly unlikely $1.8 billion loan from the Air\nTransportation Stabilization Board. "The ATSB expects an\napplicant\'s workers, suppliers and creditors to make concessions \nto help the airline repay the loans and thus protect U.S.\ntaxpayers\' interests," said the L.A. Times. Sounds nice for\nuninvolved taxpayers but not so good to some of United\'s unions, \nwhich are balking at a wage cut. Workers did enough by deferring \n$498 million in retroactive pay this year, said the\n36,000-member machinists\' union. Analysts moaned in anti-labor\nfrustration. \n\nThe basic problem here is too many empty airplane seats, and\nnon-U.S. outlets didn\'t have a lot of sympathy. "The U.S.\ngovernment has bailed out carriers with insurance subsidies and\nfederal loan guarantees" while "European authorities have acted\nmore wisely," letting Swissair and Sabena "go to the wall," said \nthe Financial Times. Canadian pundits agreed that America should \nlet a couple of airlines wilt, since the Canadian airline\nindustry benefited from the demise of Canadian Airlines and\nCanada 3000.

These are\ncompanies that once referred to Linux as a "bathtub of code"\n(Sun) and "a cancer" (Microsoft), according to Sun\'s hometown\npaper the San Jose Mercury News.\n\nBoth companies are taking Linux seriously despite the absolute\nnumbers. By January 2, 2001, Microsoft had made as much on\nserver software as all Linux vendors put together would reap in\nthe entire year.\n\nHonors for the best attention-grabber on Microsoft\'s presence at \nthe show go to Brier Dudley, who opened his piece for the\nSeattle Times this way: "Microsoft executive Peter Houston\nwasn\'t too worried about the reception he\'d get at LinuxWorld\n... until he heard about the pie cannon."\n\nWired informed us that the section of LinuxWorld where Microsoft \nwill be holding the fort is dubbed the Rookery -- "a place where \nyou can watch companies hatch and grow right before your eyes,"\ndeadpanned reporter Michelle Delio, quoting Microsoft\'s Houston: \n"Hatching isn\'t exactly on the agenda, but I certainly hope to\ngrow."\n\nTurning to Sun, Unspun notes that five years ago a joke press\nrelease circulated on the Net claiming that Linux creator Linus\nTorvalds, then still living in Finland, was moving to Silicon\nValley to work for Sun. The joke was that Sun had decided to\nscrap its Solaris operating system and instead concentrate on a\nversion of Linux, to be called "Solinux." How time does make\nApril fools of us all: Linus Torvalds is now thriving in Silicon \nValley (at Transmeta), and yesterday Sun Microsystems\ndemonstrated Sun Linux 5.0. and introduced its first\ngeneral-purpose servers running Linux.\n\nThe Merc ran a comprehensive wrap of Sun\'s evolving attitude\ntoward the upstart operating system. Sun has little choice but\nto embrace Linux, wrote reporter Therese Poletti, because some\nof its traditional Wall Street customers were deserting it.\n"Several investment banks have tossed out whole sections of Sun\nservers and replaced them with Intel-based servers running\nLinux," Poletti reported.
