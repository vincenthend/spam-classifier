{'body': "Hi ladies,\n\nI setup a cron job to do a full backup to tape drive there last night, but\nI'm just wondering how I can verify that it actually ran? \nI suppose that a mail will be sent to root as I ran crontab -e as root. Is\nthat correct or should I be looking elsewhere?\n\nThanks to everyone who replies in advance. \n\nBest Regards\nCW\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n", 'subject': '[ILUG] Checking that cronjobs actually ran?'}
