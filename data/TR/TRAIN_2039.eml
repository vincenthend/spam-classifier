If everybody except one says that a mail is spam, the \none guy will see his trust go down dramatically. If you are with the \nmajority, your trust goes up. If you are against the majority, your \ntrust goes down. If people 50-50, whatever you vote, your neither \nagainst the majority nor with it, so your trust won\'t change. So your\n"gray" mail won\'t have much influence on your trust (neither good nor \nbad, just... gray)\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nRazor-users mailing list\nRazor-users@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-users\n\n\n', 'subject': '[Razor-users] Re: keep submitting known spam?'}
