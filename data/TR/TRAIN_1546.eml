In my case I much prefer wicd to handle my wireless.  \n\nThe update had them both running simultaneously, which I didn\'t like at all.  I was plugged into my wired network, which wicd had set up as default, and network-manger connected to one of the wireless networks I had configured.  Both interfaces up, even two default routes.  Yuk.\n\nI didn\'t like the fact that the KDE update ignored my current install of wicd to install network-manager, and when I purged network-manager KDE worked (and continues to work) just fine.\n\nSo the "dependency" on network-manager seems to be merely a preference of the KDE team.  To me that means I should not have seen network-manager if I already had wicd installed.  This is very similar to the various packages that insist they need avahi-daemon to work, and yet purging avahi-daemon doesn\'t break anything not using mDNS.\n\nSo while Thomas could file a bug, I don\'t think it\'s not germane to complain about DDs putting everything under the sun into a dependency list.  Here\'s the place for the community to decide whether we really need to force an install of network-manager (or avahi) when they\'re not really needed, or decide that because some cases might require it everyone should have it.\n\nAnyway, just my 2c\n\nJames ------------------------------------ \n\nOnly time I have incurred this is when I have preferences set to\ninclude "recommended" files as "dependencies" thereby passing control\nof the upgrade to the system. Not a good idea BTW!! I use synaptic most\nof the time & I suspect aptitude has a similar setting. command line\nupdates do not have this issue.:-)\n\n\n-- \nJohn Foster\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
