And from my experience, it seems very few \'traditional\' user  \r\ngroups actually cater for the demographic that Apple is now chasing.\r\n\r\n\r\n>> << Years ago, the local store did allow us to meet there twice.   \r\n>> Once in the\r\n>> first year of their existence, once in the second.

In fact, I am curious to see how ALL  \r\nUser Groups feel about this point!\r\nAre User Groups in fact the \'ideal audience\' for Apple? Or would Apple  \r\njust be preaching to the converted?\r\n\r\n>> finding a place to hold your meetings is just a function of that  \r\n>> task.

I\'ve been in the situation where I\'ve had to find a last  \r\nminute replacement OR usually BE the last minute replacement. Yes it  \r\nis embarrassing, but these things do unfortunately happen.\r\n\r\nI\'ve even been known to be the cause of such cancelations to groups  \r\nmyself :(\r\nOften I\'m booked month\'s in advance to present to a group... then  \r\ncircumstances change and I have to cancel.\r\nOther times, I\'ve had initial discussions about presenting, again  \r\nmonths in advance, and then I hear nothing until the night before the  \r\npresentation... asking if am I still OK with \'tomorrow\' !@#!$!$^ \r\n%&^*(Q@# is all I can say.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of ways of gently reminding a presenter that they  \r\nhave a presentation coming up soon... and harking back to the original  \r\ntopic of this thread... a forwarding of a Press Release you\'ve sent  \r\nout a month before the meeting that mentions the \'forthcoming meeting  \r\nnext month\' is one simple way of doing so. It also shows that you care  \r\nenough about the topic/presenter to promote it.\r\n\r\n\r\n>> That really annoyed we board members, because we were made to look  \r\n>> like\r\n>> idiots and our general membership was highly disappointed.

But then I say, get out and bang the drum, do we really  \r\n>> need Apple?\r\n>\r\n> Yes, we really do.\r\n>\r\n> Increasingly, the average owner/user of Apple products thinks that  \r\n> the local\r\n> Apple Store is the one and only place for to further the Apple  \r\n> experience.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, it is the best place for many people.\r\nI hate to say it, but I cringe at some of the comments I see on User  \r\nGroup mailing lists etc about what a product may or may not do and how  \r\nwrong those responses are!\r\nAn example I\'ve seen twice on different lists in recent weeks is the  \r\npoint about iPads and if they are \'locked\' to AT&T... for starters  \r\nboth people inquiring were talking about iPads with WiFi only - so  \r\nautomatically there is no need to even mention been locked in to  \r\nAT&T.  Secondly, both groups were located in Australia and whilst one  \r\nwas talking about importing an iPad from the US, the other was asking  \r\nif they could use it in the UK when they visited family there later in  \r\nthe year.\r\nSteve Jobs made it abundantly clear in his Keynote speech launching  \r\nthe iPad that it was NOT locked to any carrier... yet on both MUG  \r\nlists, people responded saying the iPad was likely to be locked in to  \r\nAT&T and so the people inquiring would not be able to use the iPad as  \r\nthey had hoped... which was just plain wrong!\r\n\r\nNow, I not saying that User Groups always get it wrong... more often  \r\nthen not they don\'t and they do actually provide an independent  \r\nviewpoint... for example, the discussion on this very list about how  \r\nbest to demo an iPad was very enlightening and provided far more  \r\ninformation on the topic then I got out of my contacts at Apple  \r\nAustralian (and Apple US) on how do do the same thing when the iPhone  \r\nfirst came out here (about 18 months AFTER the US go it - so it wasn\'t  \r\nexactly the latest news then and I\'m sure others had similar queries  \r\nat  the time).\r\n\r\n> The message of user groups is lost in the scale of the Apple media  \r\n> presence.\r\n\r\nThen it is up to User Groups to address that themselves.... which  \r\nagain harks back to the original topic of this thread\r\n\r\nHere in Australia, we have taken steps towards addressing this... I  \r\nproduced a full page flyer promoting active Apple User Groups here.\r\n\r\nSee Page 15 of the Feb/Mar issue of the AppleUsers Spotlight (a 30+  \r\npage digital format magazine I publish here in Australia) for an  \r\nexample of the ad.\r\nhttp://www.appleusers.org/magazine/february-2010-issue-of-appleusers-spotlight-now-available/\r\n\r\nThe \'electronic\' copy of the flyer has each user group name as an  \r\nactive hyperlink, so people can jump straight to a group in their state.\r\nIf it appeared in a printed magazine or flyer, then there is still the  \r\nsimple URL that can easily be typed in which lands you at a page with  \r\nlinks to the various groups own webpages.\r\n\r\nThe \'primary\' URL used on the flyer was actually put to a vote and  \r\neveryone agreed that we wouldn\'t use the www.apple.com/au/usergroup  \r\nlink (or even the www.apple.com.au/usergroup one) as quite a few of  \r\nthe \'active\' groups here have chosen NOT to be listed there - so they  \r\ncan be seen as been independent from Apple (and any other retailer)  \r\nand also due to the fact that listing often falls out of date.\r\n\r\n\r\nI just realised that the ad needs updating - we don\'t mention the iPad  \r\nin the current version :)\r\n\r\nWe also have a portrait version on hand if we need it... in fact, the  \r\nflyer started out as an A4 size portrait flyer when we were approached  \r\nto have an ad in one of Australian Macworld\'s Super Guide publications  \r\n- unfortunately we couldn\'t arrange enough funding to go ahead with  \r\nthe idea in the time frame at hand... but now we have a solid basis to  \r\nwork from the next time an opportunity presents itself\r\n\r\nThere is nothing stopping a group of User Groups in a \'state\',  \r\n\'region\' or \'area\' from getting together and producing their own  \r\nversion of such an ad.\r\n\r\nI also love what Mac Users UK have done with their Google map showing  \r\nthe location of each User Group in the UK (and Ireland)\r\nhttp://www.macusersuk.org/mugs/mugsmap.php  I really must work out how  \r\nto create such a Map for Australian User Groups :)\r\n\r\n\r\n> Let me make an analogy...  At music fairs like Lollapalooza and  \r\n> Lilith Fair,\r\n> there are secondary stages where lots of great musicians and groups  \r\n> get\r\n> major exposure.  They\'re not getting the limelight, but they sure  \r\n> get in\r\n> front of lots of people they wouldn\'t otherwise.\r\n>\r\n> Not only do we not get secondary stage placement, but we can\'t even  \r\n> hang out\r\n> at the gate to the event and have a banner or people handing out  \r\n> flyers\r\n> about our groups.\r\n\r\nActually, most \'concerts\' and major events organisers discourage  \r\n\'hawkers\' from \'hassling\' people at the gates/entrance... but they\'ll  \r\nquite happily take your groups money and let you have a concession  \r\nstand near by (and usually take a percentage of your gross takings as  \r\nwell)\r\n\r\nAnd why should Apple be expected do the marketing for independent User  \r\nGroups???\r\nYes, I know User Groups \'promote\' Apple products... but we have chosen  \r\nto do so... we aren\'t compelled to do so.\r\nWe come together in User Groups (or even in online communities such as  \r\nthis) to meet with like minded people and discuss things about a  \r\ncommon topic of interest to us... just like there are groups that get  \r\ntogether as book clubs, or reptile keepers, even "gunzels" get  \r\ntogether through their common interest in trains (real ones and model  \r\nones).  No one makes them form these groups nor force people to  \r\nparticipate... and most other \'hobbies\' aren\'t so (un)fortunate to  \r\nhave a \'central\' business or entity to focus around, yet they survive  \r\nand even flourish all by themselves.\r\n\r\n> Chris\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nNicholas Pyers (nicholas@appleusers.org)\r\nFounder & Publisher, AppleUsers.org\r\n\r\nhttp://www.appleusers.org/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
