It was \r\nmarked invalid a short while later when I reported that the problem went \r\naway with a reboot.\r\n\r\n<http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/369>\r\n\r\nSince that ticket was closed, I have seen the same problem on a second \r\nsystem running 10.5.8 (a PowerBook G4 15").  A reboot also solved the \r\nproblem on the second system.  Unfortunately I haven\'t seen the problem \r\nappear again on either of my two systems, so I can\'t offer any help in \r\nroot causing it.\r\n\r\nMike\r\n-- \r\nMike Thornburg\r\nmthorn@cisco.com\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
