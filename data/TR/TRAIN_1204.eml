It was \nmarked invalid a short while later when I reported that the problem went \naway with a reboot.\n\n<http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/369>\n\nSince that ticket was closed, I have seen the same problem on a second \nsystem running 10.5.8 (a PowerBook G4 15").  A reboot also solved the \nproblem on the second system.  Unfortunately I haven\'t seen the problem \nappear again on either of my two systems, so I can\'t offer any help in \nroot causing it.\n\nMike\n-- \nMike Thornburg\nmthorn@cisco.com\n _______________________________________________\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
