There are quite a few ways to \nfix that.  I think I'm going to focus my efforts on getting Akonadi/SQLite \nready for a release that is compatible with KDE SC 4.4 but occurs before the \nfreeze date, as well as documenting how to use it.\n-- \nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr.           \t ,= ,-_-. =.\nbss@iguanasuicide.net            \t((_/)o o(\\_))\nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy \t `-'(. .)`-'\nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/        \t     \\_/\n", 'subject': 'Re: KDE 4.4.3 in unstable'}
