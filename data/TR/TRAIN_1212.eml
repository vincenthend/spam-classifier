That way you get them when you are\nediting your message.  Also, by using comps files for specific\nfolders you can alter your .sig per folder (and other tricks).  See\nthe docs for (n)mh for all the details.\n\nThere might (must?) also be a way to get sedit to do it, but I\'ve\nbeen using gvim as my exmh message editor for a long time now.  I\nload it with a command that loads some email-specific settings, eg,\nto "syntax" colour-highlight the headers and quoted parts of an\nemail)... it would be possible to map some (vim) keys that would add\na sig (or even give a selection of sigs to choose from).\n\nAnd there are all sorts of ways to have randomly-chosen sigs...\nsomewhere at rtfm.mit.edu... ok, here we go:\nrtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet-by-group/news.answers/signature_finger_faq.\n(Warning... it\'s old, May 1995).\n\n> Regards,\n> Ulises\n\nHope this helps.\n\nCheers\nTony\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-users mailing list\nExmh-users@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: Insert signature'}
