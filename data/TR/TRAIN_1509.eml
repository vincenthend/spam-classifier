If you are planning to\nkeep anything important on this system, I\'d think twice about using\na filesystem that\'s still in flux:\n\nhttps://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page\n\n"Btrfs is under heavy development, but every effort is being made to\nkeep the filesystem stable and fast. As of 2.6.31, we only plan to\nmake forward compatible disk format changes, and many users have been\nexperimenting with Btrfs on their systems with good results. Please\nemail the Btrfs mailing list if you have any problems or questions\nwhile using Btrfs."\n\n-- \nmonique\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
