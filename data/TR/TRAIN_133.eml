I believe that you can also specify the\nextension as .mpg or .mpeg if you\'ve got the mpeg plug-in built.\n\nCheers,\nDave.\n\n-- \n       David Neary,\n    Marseille, France\n  E-Mail: bolsh@gimp.org\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users\' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: [ILUG] web amusements...'}
