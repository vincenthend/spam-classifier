{'body': 'I have noticed that when printing multi-page PDF files from evince on \r\nthe GNOME desktop, using CUPS under Debian Lenny, I get a blank page\r\nafter every page.  My printer is an HP PaintJet.  This wastes paper and\r\nis very annoying.  I have searched the Internet, of course, but I did\r\nnot find any solutions.  The closest I found was Debian bug report 316392,\r\nbut his work-around doesn\'t work for me.  My PPD file already specifies\r\nLetter instead of A4 for Page Size.  Does anyone know a work-around for\r\nthis?  Surely someone has run across this before.\r\n\r\n-- \r\n  .\'\'`.
