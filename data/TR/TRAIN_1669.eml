{'body': 'I have noticed that when printing multi-page PDF files from evince on \nthe GNOME desktop, using CUPS under Debian Lenny, I get a blank page\nafter every page.  My printer is an HP PaintJet.  This wastes paper and\nis very annoying.  I have searched the Internet, of course, but I did\nnot find any solutions.  The closest I found was Debian bug report 316392,\nbut his work-around doesn\'t work for me.  My PPD file already specifies\nLetter instead of A4 for Page Size.  Does anyone know a work-around for\nthis?  Surely someone has run across this before.\n\n-- \n  .\'\'`.
