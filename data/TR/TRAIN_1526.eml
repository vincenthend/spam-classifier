{'body': 'Hi again:\n\nI have a big NFS partition shared and mounted on 3 debian serves\n(mountpoint /snapshosts). NFS partition es ext3 and I have a backup\nscript, on every server, which makes a tar from some   lvm snaphost .\nI mean, my 3 servers maek their tar backup at the same time on\n/snapshots NFS partition. This partition is only use to make this\nbackups. My question is:\n\nIs recommendable to use  gfs or other filesystem insted of ext3 in\n/snapshots NFS partition?\nAny other recommendation?\n\nthanks in advance.\n\n-- \nRegards;\nIsrael Garcia\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
