All lines are like this:\r\n\r\n./pool/main/z/zvbi/zvbi_0.2.30-1_i386.deb: OK\r\n./pool/main/z/zzuf/zzuf_0.12-1_i386.deb: OK\r\n\r\nwhile with DVD 3 there were 167 lines like this:\r\n\r\n./pool/main/a/asc/asc-data_2.1.0.0-1_all.deb: FAILED\r\n./pool/main/b/balazar/balazar_0.3.4.ds1-3_all.deb: FAILED\r\n./pool/main/h/hgsvn/hgsvn_0.1.6-2_all.deb: FAILED\r\n./pool/main/s/simutrans/simutrans-data_100.0+ds1-4_all.deb: FAILED\r\n\r\nI guess I am doing something wrong as one method showed that DVDs 2,4,5\r\nare bad while other test passed OK. At least I do know that\r\npackages I was trying to install from DVD 3 are bad.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\nMartin\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
