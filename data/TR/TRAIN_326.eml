Textual changes will, but don't know \nabout removing the execute bit or the like.\n\nRegards,\nAndrei\n-- \nOfftopic discussions among Debian users and developers:\nhttp://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/d-community-offtopic\n", 'subject': 'Re: Disable server so it does not start on reboot (even after\n upgrade)?'}
