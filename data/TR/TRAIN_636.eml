{'body': "\nPolitical mail (the snail kind) doesn't bother me.  I like it a lot of the \ntime, because as crap as it is at least it's not the kind of info you get \non TV.  Particularly for small time local politics, it's the best way to \nget information.\n\nbut what matters is that mail is speech, and political email has to be as\nwell protected as any other political speech.  Spam is *the* tool for\ndissident news, since the face that it's unsolicited means that recipients\ncan't be blamed for being on a mailing list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n", 'subject': 'Re: The case for spam'}
