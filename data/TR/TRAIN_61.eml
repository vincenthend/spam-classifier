{'body': '>See Jared Diamond\'s excellent "Guns, Germs, and Steel" for the story.\n\nYeah, I know the party line.  The evidence for it is extremely meagre.\nNew Worlders had two entire continents and tens of millions of people,\nwhich is a plenty big enough reservoir for infectious diseases to thrive\nin.  Their records show that they were plagued with them long before 1492.\n\nTake Ireland in the early 1800s.  Assume a population of circa 8\nmillion.  Take Ireland around 1900.  Assume a population not much\nabove 3 million.  Ignore natural variations between mortality and\nnatality.  Omit emigration.  Observe the Great Famine in the middle.\nDeduce that it killed 5 million (actually about 1).  Transpose to 16th\ncentury Mexico.  Grossly inflate estimates of pre-contact population,\nbecause nobody has a damn clue what it was anyway.  Underestimate\nlater population levels.  Deduce that 10\'s of millions died.  Lather,\nrinse, repeat.\n\nR\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n', 'subject': "Re: Al'Qaeda's fantasy ideology: Policy Review no. 114"}
