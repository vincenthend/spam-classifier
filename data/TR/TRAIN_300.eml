{'body': 'Over at AppleUsers.org, we have been updating our list of active Apple =20=\r\n\r\nUser Groups in Australia as we=92ve recently seen one group fold, =20\r\nanother start up and a few whose details had changed and we thought =20\r\nthis would be an opportune time to seek any other active Apple User =20\r\nGroups that may wish to be included in our listings.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we are looking for any groups in Tasmania (after all, =20\r\nthe Apple Isle should have Apple User Groups :) ) and in the Northern =20=\r\n\r\nTerritory as we have no active groups recorded for those regions at =20\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nWe are also interested in hearing from =91PC-based=92 groups that also =20=\r\n\r\nhave Special Interest Groups for Mac, iPod, iPhone or iPad users.\r\nOr maybe you are a U3A or Seniors Computer Club that has a dedicated =20\r\nsession for the users of Apple products? If so, we are happy to =20\r\ninclude you in our listing.\r\n\r\nTo see if your group is listed with us, visit the AppleUsers.org User =20=\r\n\r\nGroup Listing page and if your group isn=92t listed, we don=92t know =\r\nabout =20\r\nyou :( So fill in the form at the bottom of the page and we=92ll add =\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nIf your group is listed, you might as well take the opportunity to =20\r\nconfirm that we have your web address correctly listed. If we don=92t, =20=\r\n\r\nthen just fill out the form again.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.appleusers.org/mug-listings/\r\n\r\n--\r\nNicholas Pyers (nicholas@appleusers.org)\r\nFounder & Publisher, AppleUsers.org\r\n\r\nhttp://www.appleusers.org/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
