{'body': 'Over at AppleUsers.org, we have been updating our list of active Apple  \nUser Groups in Australia as we’ve recently seen one group fold,  \nanother start up and a few whose details had changed and we thought  \nthis would be an opportune time to seek any other active Apple User  \nGroups that may wish to be included in our listings.\n\nIn particular, we are looking for any groups in Tasmania (after all,  \nthe Apple Isle should have Apple User Groups :) ) and in the Northern  \nTerritory as we have no active groups recorded for those regions at  \npresent.\n\nWe are also interested in hearing from ‘PC-based’ groups that also  \nhave Special Interest Groups for Mac, iPod, iPhone or iPad users.\nOr maybe you are a U3A or Seniors Computer Club that has a dedicated  \nsession for the users of Apple products? If so, we are happy to  \ninclude you in our listing.\n\nTo see if your group is listed with us, visit the AppleUsers.org User  \nGroup Listing page and if your group isn’t listed, we don’t know about  \nyou :( So fill in the form at the bottom of the page and we’ll add you.\n\nIf your group is listed, you might as well take the opportunity to  \nconfirm that we have your web address correctly listed. If we don’t,  \nthen just fill out the form again.\n\nhttp://www.appleusers.org/mug-listings/\n\n--\nNicholas Pyers (nicholas@appleusers.org)\nFounder & Publisher, AppleUsers.org\n\nhttp://www.appleusers.org/\n\n\n\n\n\n _______________________________________________\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
