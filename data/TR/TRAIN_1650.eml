If you use Raid 5 then the\r\nprobability of an unrecoverable read error (URE) occurring while\r\nrebuilding the 4TB of data is IMO a little too high. With Raid 6 it\r\nwould require 2 URE\'s that happen to be located in the same raid\r\nsegment on both disks - the odds of that are extremely low.\r\n\r\nmy 2c,- tim\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
