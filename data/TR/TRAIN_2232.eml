But then alsa-driver requires alsa-kernel, and I don\'t quite \nlike --nodeps...\n\n> This would be a tricky one since to use the "--with <name>" feature of\n> rpmbuild, I think you\'d need to add individual handling of each and every\n> card :-/\n\nThat\'s ok.  I was only considering it for the sake of tweaking anyway, not \nfor some real-world need :).\n\n> That\'s what the "alsa-driver" is there for, create all the base files\n> excluding the kernel drivers.

I keep 2.4.18-12.2 for emergency sitations (like I forget to include \nkeyboard support in kernel, dumb me), but alsa-kernel_2.4.18-10 does not \nrequire kernel-2.4.18-10, so that\'s ok.\n\n> Matthias\n\n-silent\n\n-- \n...
