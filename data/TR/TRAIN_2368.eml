You can track down old flames from college, or you can dig up some dirt on your boss to make sure you get that next promotion! \n  \nOr maybe you want a fake diploma to hang on your bedroom wall.  You\'ll find addresses for companies that make these diplomas on the Banned CD. \nNeed to disappear fast and never look back?  No problem! \nUsing the Banned CD, you will learn how to build a completely \nnew identity. \nObviously, the Powers That Be don\'t want you to have the Banned CD.
