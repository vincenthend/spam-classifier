Do you *understand* whats going on there?\r\n\r\nI am a Linux trainer, consultant and administrator since >5 years and=20\r\nstill don\'t get *why* this happen and *what* it triggers. I might get it=20\r\nwhen I study MySQL, DBUS, Resource Agents, Nepomuk, *whatever* else it=20\r\nuses - but I am and I want to be *just a user* of this stuff.=20\r\n\r\nSo I think this is for upstream to solve - and if it ain\'t work reliably=20\r\nin KDE 4.4 I think it has to be fixed within KDE 4.4 series. Akonadi might=\r\n=20\r\nuse MySQL or not, but it if uses it, KAddressBook should still just work=20\r\n*predictably*.\r\n\r\nThus I suggest reporting anything like that upstream - especially to you,=20\r\nBoyd - complaining here probably just won\'t help. And if upstream does not=\r\n=20\r\nget bug reports they probably don\'t even know that something is broken on=20\r\nprobably only *some* systems.\r\n\r\nSome issues might be packaging related, but then I hope to get hints back=20\r\nfrom upstream developers so that I can file debian bug reports with proper=\r\n=20\r\nsuggestions. Until then I think I default to reporting upstream, unless=20\r\nsomeone convinces me to do elsewise.\r\n\r\nCiao,\r\n=2D-=20\r\nMartin \'Helios\' Steigerwald - http://www.Lichtvoll.de\r\nGPG: 03B0 0D6C 0040 0710 4AFA  B82F 991B EAAC A599 84C7\r\n', 'subject': 'Re: akonadi first time start bugs with KDE 4.4.3'}
