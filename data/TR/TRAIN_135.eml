Do you *understand* whats going on there?\n\nI am a Linux trainer, consultant and administrator since >5 years and \nstill don't get *why* this happen and *what* it triggers. I might get it \nwhen I study MySQL, DBUS, Resource Agents, Nepomuk, *whatever* else it \nuses - but I am and I want to be *just a user* of this stuff. \n\nSo I think this is for upstream to solve - and if it ain't work reliably \nin KDE 4.4 I think it has to be fixed within KDE 4.4 series. Akonadi might \nuse MySQL or not, but it if uses it, KAddressBook should still just work \n*predictably*.\n\nThus I suggest reporting anything like that upstream - especially to you, \nBoyd - complaining here probably just won't help. And if upstream does not \nget bug reports they probably don't even know that something is broken on \nprobably only *some* systems.\n\nSome issues might be packaging related, but then I hope to get hints back \nfrom upstream developers so that I can file debian bug reports with proper \nsuggestions. Until then I think I default to reporting upstream, unless \nsomeone convinces me to do elsewise.\n\nCiao,\n-- \nMartin 'Helios' Steigerwald - http://www.Lichtvoll.de\nGPG: 03B0 0D6C 0040 0710 4AFA  B82F 991B EAAC A599 84C7\n", 'subject': 'Re: akonadi first time start bugs with KDE 4.4.3'}
