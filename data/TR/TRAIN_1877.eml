I=\r\n\'m=20\r\ngradually moving that way myself.  (Desktop and laptop each need one driver=\r\n=20\r\nfrom non-free.)\r\n\r\nOnce you\'ve got the hardware, you might as well use it, even if it requires=\r\n=20\r\nnon-free drivers.  The manufacturer has already got their cut of what you=20\r\npaid; you are hurting none but yourself by not using it.  You should try an=\r\nd=20\r\navoid becoming dependent on that hardware, since that makes you dependent o=\r\nn=20\r\nnon-free software.\r\n\r\n[1] "Firmware" here is specifically limited to executable data transmitted =\r\nto=20\r\nthe device from a host operating system, and does not include executable da=\r\nta=20\r\nloaded from an EEPROM (or similar) that is provided with the device.\r\n=2D-=20\r\nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr.           \t ,=3D ,-_-. =3D.\r\nbss@iguanasuicide.net            \t((_/)o o(\\_))\r\nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy \t `-\'(. .)`-\'\r\nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/        \t     \\_/\r\n', 'subject': 'Re: The future of "nv" driver (was: Linux compatible mainboards -another thought)'}
