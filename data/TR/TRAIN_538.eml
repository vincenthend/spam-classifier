Of course, \'sophisticated\' and \'Western\nCivilization\' are essentially equivalent IMHO.  But it need not be so.\n\n> D) The Northern Ireland Protestant vs. Catholic feud, recently more or\n> less concluded, is not completely unlike this kind of friction\ngenerated\n> by splitting society too much along religious lines.

Hindu extremism isn\'t about the Hindu\nreligious theology as far as I can see.  It is a peg to hang an ethnic\nidentity and identity politics on.\n\nMuslim extremism appears to have a far greater connection to theology.\n\n> \'Northern Ireland is a British province of green valleys and\n> cloud-covered hills whose 1.6 million people are politically and\n> religiously divided.

That and the introduction of potatoes saved the Irish as\nIrish.\n\n> That\'s fine, as it would be an inappropriate concentration.

I\nknow it is there, but it just might not be appropriate to admit it\npublicly.\n\n> >3.

With the exception of ethnic\nrestaurants, I can generally be counted on to oppose anything labeled\n\'multi-cultural\'.\n\n> >I didn\'t say burning the train was a good thing.
