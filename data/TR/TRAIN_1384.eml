Windows and Macintosh\nhave a slightly different mechanism and one uniform policy.  I\'m quite\nsure that Tk implements all PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD selections accurately.\nThe PRIMARY selection is the one that is tied to the visible selection\non your X display.  The CLIPBOARD selection is the one with the explicit\nCopy step, and is the same as what you have on Windows and Macintosh.\nHowever, exmh throws in support for the cutbuffer mechanism, which is\nanother archaic mechanism supported at one point (perhaps still today)\nby versions of emacs.  Exmh has a policy that tries to unify all these\nmechanisms under one umbrella, and by all reports it is not that great.\n\nI would encourage folks to play with those 10 lines of code in\nText_Selection and report what works well for them.  We may come up\nwith 8 lines that work for everyone, or perhaps introduce yet another\nsetting that lets folks choose between a few useful models.  Of course,\nthat\'s an admission of policy failure, but I\'m willing to do that.\n\n--\nBrent Welch\nSoftware Architect, Panasas Inc\nPioneering the World\'s Most Scalable and Agile Storage Network\nwww.panasas.com\nwelch@panasas.com\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-users mailing list\nExmh-users@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: bad focus/click behaviours'}
