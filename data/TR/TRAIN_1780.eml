It also claims to\nprovide kernel-sources at the same version.  That is enough to make\nalsa-driver.spec happy, and at least forms a reasonable representation\nof what my homemade kernel provides to the system.  I should have\nthought of this approach sooner.\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: alsa-driver.spec tweak for homemade kernels'}
