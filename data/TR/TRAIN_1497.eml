You should only see grey radio buttons in =\r\nJava Preferences if you don\'t have write permissions in that directory. =\r\nIt\'s possible that if you have other Java plugins present in your =\r\n~/Library/Internet Plug-Ins folder, that could be confusing the =\r\nlogic...maybe.\r\n\r\nCan you "ls -al@e /Library/Internet\\ Plug-ins" and "ls -al@e =\r\n~/Library/Internet\\ Plug-ins" to see what plugins are present, and if =\r\nthere are any funny ACLs or extended attributes?\r\n\r\nBest of luck,\r\nMike Swingler\r\nJava Runtime Engineer\r\nApple Inc.\r\n\r\n> On Fri, May 21, 2010 at 7:28 PM, Mike Swingler <swingler@apple.com> =\r\nwrote:\r\n>=20\r\n>> There is a known race condition between native background repainting =\r\nand Java drawing in the resize/scrolling case for Java applets embedded =\r\nin the browser process. The reason you don\'t see this behavior when =\r\nusing the out-of-process plugin is because the applet painting is =\r\nhappening in a seperate process, and the browser is "pulling the pixels" =\r\nfrom the Java process when the browser thinks it\'s a good time to =\r\nrepaint.\r\n>>=20\r\n>> I\'m not clear why unchecking the "64-bit" checkbox in Java =\r\nPreferences should enable or disable the out-of-process vs. in-process =\r\napplet setting.
