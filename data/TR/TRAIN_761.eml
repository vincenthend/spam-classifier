I am not subscribed to any of the other lists.\n\nI am not a Debian package maintainer or a Debian developer.  I am just an\nordinary system administrator.  So I\'m sure that my opinion will not count\nfor much.  But I am opposed to the removal of lilo.  Both grub-legacy and\ngrub-pc use sectors on the hard disk outside of the master boot record\n(cylinder 0, head 0, sector 1).  In other words they use cylinder 0, head 0,\nsector 2 and possibly subsequent sectors on cylinder 0 head 0.  This breaks\nthe design of the backup software that my employer uses.  This backup software\nbacks up the master boot record and all partitions; but since the extra\nsectors used by grub-legacy and grub-pc are outside the master boot record\nand are not part of any partition, they don\'t get backed up.  Consequently,\nif we have a hard drive failure and restore from a backup, we have an\nunbootable machine.  Lilo uses only the master boot record.  A lilo-booted\nmachine can be backed up and restored with our existing backup software\njust fine.  Given these requirements, I wouldn\'t use grub-pc even if it\nwere bug free and well documented.  (But neither is the case!)\n\nAs for the claims that kernels are too big now, I find that hard to\nbelieve, especially now that we have the large-memory option available.\nThe standard stock Debian kernel image file that I use for Squeeze,\nvmlinuz-2.6.32-3-686, is currently 2234080 bytes.  Are you trying to tell\nme that there\'s no room for a 2M kernel below the start of the EBDA?\n\nI am able to load *both* the kernel *and* the initial RAM filesystem\nbelow the EBDA (i.e. the large-memory option is not used) if I use\nMODULES=dep instead of MODULES=most in the initial RAM filesystem\nunder Lenny.  I\'ll bet I can do it with Squeeze too.\n\nI realize that lilo doesn\'t work for everyone, and I\'m not suggesting\nthat it be the default bootloader; but to get rid of it entirely is\nunacceptable.  As far as I know, it\'s the only bootloader that meets\nall of my requirements, and I will not voluntarily give it up.\n\nNo doubt you will tell me that I am welcome to maintain it myself.\nUnfortunately, I do not have the requisite skills to do so.  All I\ncan do is to appeal in the name of reason that it not be dropped.\n\nAlso, please excuse my ignorance, but what exactly is this\n"payload size" to which you refer?  Is that the same thing as the\nsize of the kernel?  Or is it something else?\n\n-- \n  .\'\'`.
