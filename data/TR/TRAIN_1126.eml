{'body': 'I\'m fairly confused here, with Procmail. \nI know this isn\'t a procmail list per-se; feel free to answer my questions in \nprivate email to r_gilmanhunt@hotp.com.  \n\nI\'ve looked for web-stuff to answer this question but I can\'t find anything \nspecific on this scenario.\n\nHere\'s the situation. \nI have a global /etc/procmailrc file. It works, and when I insert stuff into \nit for logging (LOGFILE=/root/procmail.log, VERBOSE=yeah. LOGABSTRACT=all) it \nshows up where I expect it to (the log in /root/procmail.log)  At the end of \nthis file, I use \n :0fw\n | spamc\nto call spamassassin.\n\nAlso in it is a carboncopy recipe (yes, I know, it\'s one of the evils we do \nfor our corporate masters)  (at the top) (to their credit, I am instructed \nthat they are not interested in the actual contents, but are concerned about \nfuture lawsuits and their culpability, so they want a record made. Discussion \non this point is immaterial)\n:0\n  * ? test -d $ARCHIVEDIR/$DATEDIR || mkdir -p --mode=750 $ARCHIVEDIR/$DATEDIR\n  { }\n:0 c\n $SAVEAT\n\nI have several users where I forward certain spams to /dev/null  . . .their \nprocmailrc file (/home/$user/.procmailrc) looks like this:\n:0\n  * ^From: .*spermfun.com\n  /dev/null\n\nNow I\'ve got a person who needs a copy of her inbound emails sent to another \nemail address (outside the company), so I\'ve got this recipe in her \n/home/$user/.procmailrc file:\n:0 c\n  !user@domain.tld\n\nIt almost looks like procmail\'s not running a user\'s copy recipe after a \nglobal copy recipe, except that I can replace that user\'s one with \n:0 \n * ^Subject: .*test\n  procmail.holder\nand get the same result.\n\nThe result, to put it succinctly, is "nothing". No forwards go out, no files \nare made, if I try to log information, no logs are set up. I\'ve modified the \nuser/group and permissions to match known-working recipes (the spermfun \nexample above) and still nothing.  However, I can redirect those other \nmessages.  In other words- just this user\'s procmailrc file is not working- \nother users have no problems.\n\nAny suggestions would be helpful :) \n\n-Russ\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old\ncell phone?
