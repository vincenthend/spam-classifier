I changed the arguments to Ftoc_ShowSequences to drop the folder \nargument and instead have an optional msgids argument.  Somehow your version \nof ScanFolder is still trying to pass $F.  You seem to have the latest \nftoc.tcl (1.36), but not the latest scan.tcl (1.27).\n\nI don\'t know how that happened, but try getting your source tree completely \nup to date.\n\nChris\n\n-- \nChris Garrigues                 http://www.DeepEddy.Com/~cwg/\nvirCIO                          http://www.virCIO.Com\n716 Congress, Suite 200\nAustin, TX  78701\t\t+1 512 374 0500\n\n  World War III:  The Wrong-Doers Vs. the Evil-Doers.\n\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: traceback in new exmh'}
