I had seen that bug and discounted it\nbecause the patch is only effective if smtp_tls_CApath is set, and\nmine wasn\'t set. But your mail prompted another look, and with both\nsmtp_tls_CApath = /etc/ssl/certs and applying the patch from #287795,\nit banished the "certificate verification failed" and changed\n"Untrusted TLS connection established" to "Trusted TLS connection\nestablished".\n\nSo that\'s progress :-)\n\nUnfortunately it\'s still failing to authenticate. From mail.log:\nMay  9 21:49:18 rimmer postfix/smtp[8121]: 5DE243A66: to=<MY-EMAIL-ADDRESS>, relay=NEWSERVER[NEWSERVER-IPADDR]:587, delay=5.5, delays=0.02/0.03/5.4/0, dsn=4.7.3, status=deferred (SASL authentication failed; server NEWSERVER[NEWSERVER-IPADDR] said: 535 5.7.3 Authentication unsuccessful)\n\nThanks,\nClive\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
