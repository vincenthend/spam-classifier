Sonnets.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare (1564-1616) was a famous English poet,\ndramatist, and actor, often regarded as the greatest English\nwriter of all time. Shakespeare's early life was spent in\nStratford-upon-Avon, where little else is known about him\nuntil he married at age 18 to Anne Hathaway.  He enjoyed\nquick recognition as a skilled playwright in London as a\nmember of the Lord Chamberlain's Company (also known as the\nKing's Men).  He retired in 1610, having spent a successful\ncareer as a writer and heralded by royalty and peasants\nalike.\n\nShakespeare's privacy resulted in a sketchy timeline of the\nwriter's life, leading many over the years to attempt to\nfill in the gaps, often with scraps of fact and fiction that\nonly result in nothing close to the truth (A truth we will\nprobably never know).  Among the rumors and hypotheses\noffered over the years: that he was gay; a womanizer;\nilliterate (reciting his works to a scribe), and a puppet\n(in which he didn't write the works but was encouraged to\ntake credit to shield the real writer -- a person with\npolitical ties).\n\nShakespeare's sonnets give readers a glimpse into the mind\nand heart of the playwright.  Published in 1609, the 154\nsonnets involve the author's relationship with various\ncharacters, including a striking young man, a mysterious\nwoman, and a rival poet.  The identities of the characters\nhave also been the subject of much speculation over the\nyears, despite the fact that they may have been completely\ncreated in the mind of the bard.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Mickie Kennedy of http://www.poetrypreviews.com\nCopyright DayTips.com, Inc., 2002.
