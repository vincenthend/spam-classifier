You\ncould however, put the files onto windows, boot onto a ILUG BBC[tm] and\nmount the fat32 partition.\n\nEasier/Quicker way is to get your hands on a PCMCIA nic.  Also makes the\nmaptop far more useful in the long run.\n\nGavin\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n", 'subject': 'Re: [ILUG] Got me a crappy laptop'}
