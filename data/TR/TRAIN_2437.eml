The file was a quicktime .mov file they made with their\r\nown camera and is on their machine so unfortunately I cannot get a snippet\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I did 2 fresh Lenny installs on my friend's machine, the first one\r\nwith debian-multimedia which resulted in the .mov file not playing back in\r\nmplayer, and a subsequent second Lenny install, identical to the first\r\nexcept without the debian-multimedia, in which the .mov file played great in\r\nmplayer.  I don't know if it's a bug or not, but has anyone else had this\r\nspecific problem (with .mov files in mplayer)?  If so I will gladly file the\r\nbug report.  I've read about several different bugs with mplayer on various\r\nforums but have not seen this one specifically.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nMark\r\n", 'subject': 'Re: [SOLVED] Debian-multimedia breaks mplayer .mov playback on Lenny?'}
