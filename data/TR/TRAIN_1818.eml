But the two new species,\notiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known\nnorth of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. "It\'s very likely\nthese weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental\nplants from Italy," said Dr Barclay. "It looks like they\'re here to stay."\nHe found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store\nin 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a\nmigrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in\nsouth-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has\nestablished itself firmly in the same area.\nApart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and\ngrape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The\nsoil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.\nOne possible explanation for the invaders\' successful colonisation of\nBritain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already a\nfact.\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
