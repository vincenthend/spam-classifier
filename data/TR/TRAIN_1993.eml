{'body': ">  in adding cream to spaghetti carbonara, which has the same effect on pasta as\n>  making a pizza a deep-pie; \n\nI just had to jump in here as Carbonara is one of my favourites to make and ask \nwhat the hell are you supposed to use instead of cream?  I've never seen a \nrecipe that hasn't used this.  Personally I use low fat creme fraiche because it \nworks quite nicely but the only time I've seen an supposedly authentic recipe \nfor carbonara  it was identical to mine (cream, eggs and lots of fresh parmesan) \nexcept for the creme fraiche.\n\nStew\n-- \nStewart Smith\nScottish Microelectronics Centre, University of Edinburgh.\nhttp://www.ee.ed.ac.uk/~sxs/\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
