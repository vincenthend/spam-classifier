It will be\navailable at the same second the distribution will, and so will a complete\napt repository already including quite a few of my packages updated for Red\nHat Linux 8.0.\n\nI didn't want to say all this before Monday, but as the new release already\nleaked from many places, and official statements made about it, it\nshouldn't be a big deal :-/\n\nI'll keep you all posted on Monday! They'll even be a big apt-related\nsurprise! ;-))))\n\nMatthias\n\n-- \nMatthias Saou                                World Trade Center\n-------------                                Edificio Norte 4 Planta\nSystem and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, Spain\nElectronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n", 'subject': 'Re: hi'}
