That\'s why they\'re not listed in package contents.\r\n\r\nKent, it seems that it\'s a somehow better solution for you to install\r\nthe lsb-core package (or a whole lsb group) rather than create that\r\nsymlink manually (it\'s not that important though).\r\n\r\nAlexey\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
