A caution: go to a store and make\nsure your future netbook supports ACPI. I\'ve had bad\nexperiences with my cheap Toshiba Satellite L305 series\nlaptop: the fan controls (and most other ACPI registers) do\nnothing.\n\nIt seems either Toshiba or the BIOS maker Insyde H2O has\nchosen non-standard SSDT/DSDT table values, with the result\nthat only Microsoft\'s OS knows where to twiddle.\n\nThere are reports that the omnibook module will correctly\nhandle Insyde H2O BIOS\'ed notebook. Have yet to test here.\n\nGood luck,\n\nJoel\n\n \n> Thanks in advance,\n> -PT\n\n-- \nJoel Roth\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
