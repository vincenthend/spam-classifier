Sullivan III,\r\n\r\nAm 2010-05-14 07:14:18, hacktest Du folgendes herunter:\r\n> That comment really strikes home.  We are working on a potential major\r\n> Windows desktop replacement project.  The two things that are absolutely\r\n> killing us are email and a viable substitute for Acrobat Standard.

There are couple of admirable efforts\r\n> out there but they have a very, very long way to go - John\r\n\r\nI create my PDFs (required for Reports and Specs) with OpenOffice <w=FCrg>\r\n\r\nNo, not the PDF stuff is <w=FCrg> but OOo which is  crap.  Switching  from\r\nM$ Office to OpenOffice let you  increase  the  Psy-Bill  more,  than  a\r\ndedicated computer with M$ Viasco plus Adobe Acrobat will cost.  Even if\r\nyou ONLY create PDFs with it.\r\n\r\nThanks, Greetings and nice Day/Evening\r\n    Michelle Konzack\r\n    Systemadministrator\r\n\r\n--=20\r\n##################### Debian GNU/Linux Consultant ######################\r\n   Development of Intranet and Embedded Systems with Debian GNU/Linux\r\n\r\nitsystems@tdnet France           itsystems@tdnet UG (haftungsbeschr=E4nkt)\r\nGesch.
