I won\'t be miserable nor get bored, don\'t worry for me ;-)\nI also have the first Lord of the Rings book to finish (half way through\nnow) and the two others to read... lots of "sane" and non-wired occupations\nahead!\nOh, did I mention beer drinking with friends? :-))))\n\nMatthias (really happy to be on holidayyyy for the first time this year!)\n\n-- \nMatthias Saou                                World Trade Center\n-------------                                Edificio Norte 4 Planta\nSystem and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, Spain\nElectronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: Holidays for freshrpms.net :-)'}
