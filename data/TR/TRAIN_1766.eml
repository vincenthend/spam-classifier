I\'m\r\nguessing that it has something to do with KMS in newer kernels.\r\nBut that\'s just a guess.  I do a lot of work in the text\r\nconsoles.  I often use an 80x50 video mode\r\n(via the VGA option of lilo), which generally\r\nworks everywhere.  Anyway, I was not happy with the fonts provided\r\nby console-setup; and I wanted to go back to the legacy fonts that are\r\nused by Lenny.  I opened\r\na thread on this forum about the problem\r\n(http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2009/12/msg01438.html) and\r\ngot a satisfactory resolution.  Here\'s what I would recommend\r\nthat you try.  First, make sure that the console-data package\r\nis installed.  Then, in /etc/default/console-setup, set\r\n\r\n   FONTFACE=""\r\n   FONTSIZE=""\r\n\r\nThen add\r\n\r\n   FONT=lat1u-16.psf.gz\r\n\r\nIn my case, I use lat1u-08.psf.gz as the font, since the 80x50 video\r\nmode requires an eight-pixel-high font; but in your case, since you\r\napparently use the traditional VGA boot-up hardware text mode\r\n(no framebuffer, I presume), you will need the sixteen-pixel-high\r\nfont.\r\n\r\nGive that a whirl and see how it goes.  This method gives a larger\r\nselection of fonts to choose from.  (lat1u-16 is a suggestion,\r\nbut there are other sixteen-pixel-high fonts you can choose from.\r\nSee the /usr/share/consolefonts directory for a complete list.)\r\nAnd in my opinion, these fonts look better too.  But most importantly,\r\nthis method may circumvent the bug you are experiencing.  If it\r\ndoes circumvent the bug, console-setup is the most suspect package.\r\n\r\n-- \r\n  .\'\'`.
