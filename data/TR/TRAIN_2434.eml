Most scientists studying global climate change believe that\nthese increased CO2 concentrations are the primary causal agent for\nincreased global warming. Hence our interest in items of human time scale.\n\n> It is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited\n> during the last major ice age, they are finding substantial evidence of\n> humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers\n> paved over their civilization.

The point of global warming\nisn\'t to save the Earth -- the planet is not sentient. The point is to\nunderstand and potentially reduce the impact of increasing temperatures on\nglobal human activity.\n\n> For anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are\n> anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another.  I\'ll\n> just stick with Occam\'s Razor for now.\n\nThe increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is due to human activity.\n\nIt is generally accepted that increases in CO2 in a closed environment\nsubject to solar heating retain more of that solar energy. This is the\ncurrent best explanation for the high temperature of Venus. If the CO2\nconcentration goes up globally (which it has), then theory states the earth\nshould be retaining greater solar energy. This process may be slow, and may\nbe difficult to monitor due to the variability of temperatures worldwide. I\nencourage you to refute any part of this causal chain linking CO2 to\neventual increases in global energy content, part of which will be evident\nas heat.\n\n- Jim\n\n\n', 'subject': 'RE: Goodbye Global Warming'}
