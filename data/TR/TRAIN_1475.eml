Apple uses a Mach-involved security model of namespaces to\ncontrol access to various things; you can find more information on it at\nhttp://developer.apple.com/mac/library/technotes/tn2005/tn2083.html.\nWorth reading.  Several times.\n\nBut the pertinent bit is ``A process can only use the global window\nserver service if its EUID is 0 (it\'s running as root) or matches the\nUID of the console user. All other users are barred from using it.\'\'\n\nI don\'t see an update of this document for 10.6, either.\n\n> How can I set up things so that graphics generation proceeds and makes\n> image files as if graphics hardware were available?

Or, of course, run your program on\nLinux or FreeBSD or OpenSolaris instead.\n\n> _______________________________________________\n> Do not post admin requests to the list.
