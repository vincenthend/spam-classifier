The X server is completely secondary, and I don\'t think Apple Java\r\ninteracts with it at all.\r\n\r\n> It seems not particularly interested in whether or not an X server is\r\n> available or the DISPLAY variable is set or whether you\'ve tunneled X\r\n> through SSH.\r\n\r\nRight.\r\n\r\n> Is there is a way to run Java graphics generation on the Mac 10.6\r\n> server without a graphics display?

Apple uses a Mach-involved security model of namespaces to\r\ncontrol access to various things; you can find more information on it at\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/mac/library/technotes/tn2005/tn2083.html.\r\nWorth reading.  Several times.\r\n\r\nBut the pertinent bit is ``A process can only use the global window\r\nserver service if its EUID is 0 (it\'s running as root) or matches the\r\nUID of the console user. All other users are barred from using it.\'\'\r\n\r\nI don\'t see an update of this document for 10.6, either.\r\n\r\n> How can I set up things so that graphics generation proceeds and makes\r\n> image files as if graphics hardware were available?

Or, of course, run your program on\r\nLinux or FreeBSD or OpenSolaris instead.\r\n\r\n> _______________________________________________\r\n> Do not post admin requests to the list.
