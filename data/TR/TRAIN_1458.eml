Take a look at "freetype-2.1.1-enable-ft2-bci.patch" from the \nSRPM; it\'s pretty clear that this does exactly what needs to be done.\n\nSo if your fonts look ugly, lack of bytecode hinting is *not* the cause.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: RedHat 8.0 and his own freetype'}
