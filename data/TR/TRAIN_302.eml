If it is happening, something is very\r\nwrong.  My own guess is that something is clearing your hold flags.  For\r\ninstance, it was recently pointed out to me that "aptitude keep-all"\r\nclears hold flags (probably wrongly).\r\n\r\n  Daniel\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
