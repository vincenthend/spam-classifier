If it is happening, something is very\nwrong.  My own guess is that something is clearing your hold flags.  For\ninstance, it was recently pointed out to me that "aptitude keep-all"\nclears hold flags (probably wrongly).\n\n  Daniel\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
