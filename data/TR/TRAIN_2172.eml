Some minor setup details are omitted from the diagram\nto keep it simple, such as the fact that /boot is a mirrored 100MB partition\nset and that there are two non mirrored 1GB swap partitions.  / and /var are\nmirrored partitions in the remaining first 30GB.  These sizes are arbitrary,\nand can be seasoned to taste.  I find these sizes work fairly well for a non\nGUI Debian server.\n\nmd raid, 4 x 500GB 7.2K rpm SATAII drives:\n\n\tmirror\t\t\t mirror\n\t/    \\\t\t\t /    \\\n --------  3  --------    --------  3  --------\n| /boot  | 0 | /boot  |  | swap1  | 0 | swap2  |\n| /      | G | /      |  | /var   | G | /var   |\n|--------|   |--------|  |--------|   |--------|\n| /home  |   | /home  |  | /home  |   | /home  |\n| /samba |   | /samba |  | /samba |   | /samba |\n| other  |   | other  |  | other  |   | other  |\n|        |   |        |  |        |   |        |\n|        |   |        |  |        |   |        |\n --------     --------    --------     --------\n\t\\\t\\\t\t/\t/\n         -------------------------------\n\t\t     RAID 10\n\t\t   940 GB NET\n\nFor approximately the same $$ outlay one could simply mirror two 1TB 7.2K\nrpm drives and have the same usable space and a little less power draw.  The\n4 drive RAID 10 setup will yield better read and write performance due to\nthe striping, especially under a multiuser workload, and especially for IMAP\nserving of large mailboxen.  For a small/medium office server running say\nPostfix/Dovecot/Samba/lighty+Roundcube webmail, a small intranet etc, the 4\ndrive setup would yield significantly better performance than the higher\ncapacity 2 drive setup.  Using Newegg\'s prices, each solution will run a\nlittle below or above $200.\n\nThis 4 drive RAID 10 makes for a nice little inexpensive and speedy setup.\n1TB of user space may not seem like much given the capacity of today\'s\ndrives, but most small/medium offices won\'t come close to using that much\nspace for a number of years, assuming you have sane email attachment policies.\n\n-- \nStan\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
