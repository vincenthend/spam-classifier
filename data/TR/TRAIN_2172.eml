Some minor setup details are omitted from the diagram\r\nto keep it simple, such as the fact that /boot is a mirrored 100MB partition\r\nset and that there are two non mirrored 1GB swap partitions.  / and /var are\r\nmirrored partitions in the remaining first 30GB.  These sizes are arbitrary,\r\nand can be seasoned to taste.  I find these sizes work fairly well for a non\r\nGUI Debian server.\r\n\r\nmd raid, 4 x 500GB 7.2K rpm SATAII drives:\r\n\r\n\tmirror\t\t\t mirror\r\n\t/    \\\t\t\t /    \\\r\n --------  3  --------    --------  3  --------\r\n| /boot  | 0 | /boot  |  | swap1  | 0 | swap2  |\r\n| /      | G | /      |  | /var   | G | /var   |\r\n|--------|   |--------|  |--------|   |--------|\r\n| /home  |   | /home  |  | /home  |   | /home  |\r\n| /samba |   | /samba |  | /samba |   | /samba |\r\n| other  |   | other  |  | other  |   | other  |\r\n|        |   |        |  |        |   |        |\r\n|        |   |        |  |        |   |        |\r\n --------     --------    --------     --------\r\n\t\\\t\\\t\t/\t/\r\n         -------------------------------\r\n\t\t     RAID 10\r\n\t\t   940 GB NET\r\n\r\nFor approximately the same $$ outlay one could simply mirror two 1TB 7.2K\r\nrpm drives and have the same usable space and a little less power draw.  The\r\n4 drive RAID 10 setup will yield better read and write performance due to\r\nthe striping, especially under a multiuser workload, and especially for IMAP\r\nserving of large mailboxen.  For a small/medium office server running say\r\nPostfix/Dovecot/Samba/lighty+Roundcube webmail, a small intranet etc, the 4\r\ndrive setup would yield significantly better performance than the higher\r\ncapacity 2 drive setup.  Using Newegg\'s prices, each solution will run a\r\nlittle below or above $200.\r\n\r\nThis 4 drive RAID 10 makes for a nice little inexpensive and speedy setup.\r\n1TB of user space may not seem like much given the capacity of today\'s\r\ndrives, but most small/medium offices won\'t come close to using that much\r\nspace for a number of years, assuming you have sane email attachment policies.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nStan\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
