{'body': '>JUST as the pyramids of Egypt were built in honour of great kings, it was\n>fitting that sandy replicas were created on Weymouth beach in memory of the\n>king of the castle.

I have an idea \nit is somewhat like the spots street musicians claim, but this sounds \nmore formal.\n------------------\nJust an area of the beach by the prom where he\'s allowed to make his\nsculptures.\nWeymouth is where I spent my teenage years. My mum and one sister still live\nthere.\nSo I\'m pretty familiar with the sculptures; pretty impressive, and very big.\n(I think he uses some sort of armature for some bits - it\'s not just sand)\nThey usually get vandalised, though; after a lot of drinks, it obviously is\na good idea to break into the enclosure and kick all the sculptures to bits.\nThen again, Weymouth is pretty run down, and attracts holiday makers of the\nworst sort.\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
