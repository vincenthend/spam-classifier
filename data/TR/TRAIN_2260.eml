{'body': "Hi Guy,\r\n                The problem is caused by an NPE in the Swing =\r\naccessibility code when a JList subclass overrides the =\r\ngetAccessibleContext() method and returns null. You can hit this crash =\r\nwhen using a tool that scans the IntelliJ UI using the Accessibility =\r\nAPI. We believe we have a fix for it, but as a workaround if you avoid =\r\nusing tools that use Accessibility with IntelliJ, you can avoid the =\r\ncrash.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBino George,\r\nJava Runtime Engineer,\r\nApple Inc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 25, 2010, at 8:29 AM, Guy Gascoigne-Piggford wrote:\r\n\r\n> Is there any update on this?
