{'body': "Hi Guy,\n                The problem is caused by an NPE in the Swing accessibility code when a JList subclass overrides the getAccessibleContext() method and returns null. You can hit this crash when using a tool that scans the IntelliJ UI using the Accessibility API. We believe we have a fix for it, but as a workaround if you avoid using tools that use Accessibility with IntelliJ, you can avoid the crash.\n\nThanks,\nBino George,\nJava Runtime Engineer,\nApple Inc.\n\n\n\nOn May 25, 2010, at 8:29 AM, Guy Gascoigne-Piggford wrote:\n\n> Is there any update on this?
