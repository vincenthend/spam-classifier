The\nfilesystem offered significant performance advantages over Ext2 _and nearly\nrivaled the high-performance XFS filesystem_ during the company\'s tests.\nExt4 was ultimately chosen over XFS because it would allow Google to do a\nlive in-place upgrade of its existing Ext2 filesystems."\n\n-- \nStan\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
