The\r\nfilesystem offered significant performance advantages over Ext2 _and nearly\r\nrivaled the high-performance XFS filesystem_ during the company\'s tests.\r\nExt4 was ultimately chosen over XFS because it would allow Google to do a\r\nlive in-place upgrade of its existing Ext2 filesystems."\r\n\r\n-- \r\nStan\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
