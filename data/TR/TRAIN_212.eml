{'body': "With enough warning, you might not even care about trying to divert \nthe meteor -- you'd divert the Earth instead.\n\nI recall reading many years ago about calculations, done separately\nboth by US and USSR scientists for different reasons, about the\neffect of nuclear explosions on the moon's mass, and thus its orbit,\nand thus also (over time) the Earth's path around the sun.\n\nI believe the conclusion was that mild changes in the moon's \ncomposition would have the effect, over several years, of changing \nsignificantly where the Earth would be at any certain future point. \n\nVoila! No collision -- at least not with the initial threat. And\nno need to travel out to anywhere near the meteor, either. Just\nthe moon.\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n", 'subject': 'Re: Asteroids anyone ?'}
