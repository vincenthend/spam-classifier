I would report. But also take a look into this:\r\n\r\nConnect HP 50g (or HP 49g+) to a Linux Box with hptalx\r\nhttp://bleedux.wordpress.com/2010/03/11/connect-hp-50g-to-a-linux-box-with-hptalx/\r\n\r\nAnd see if that helps. It seems to be written for ArchLinux (another \r\nlinux distribution) but it points some interesting things that you can \r\ncheck.\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\n\r\n-- \r\nCamale\xc3\xb3n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
