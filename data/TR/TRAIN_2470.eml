The Java application loads the library, then calls a native function that spawns a new thread.  I attach this thread to the JVM (using AttachCurrentThreadAsDaemon) and initialize a JNIEnv object.  I then use this JNIEnv object to get the Java class and a few methods (so I can get back to java on certain events).  When I run this over Java Web Start, the call that requests a method id crashes.  I have no idea why this happens, and can\'t find any related errors online.  Has anyone else run into this problem?

I have a static initializer in that class, and that\'s where it is loading and calling that native method.  How can the class not be found if that\'s where the native method is being called from?\n\nThink about it: you are calling your JNI function from the class\' static initializer. The class is not initialized yet. Attempts to find the (uninitialized) class should probably fail.\n\nRegards,\nMike Swingler\nJava Runtime Engineer\nApple Inc. _______________________________________________\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
