In any case, I would avoid trying to mix different\r\napproaches.\r\n\r\n> Another (possibly also unrelated) issue is that when several X are\r\n> running (different users, all with KDE) then it seems that only one of\r\n> them can mount and unmount, usually the wrong user.\r\n\r\nI have seen that complaint before, also for systems on which mounting\r\nworked perfectly for single-user sessions, and I am not sure if a\r\nsatisfactory solution exists. (I have no need for running multiple KDE\r\nsessions on the same machine, therefore I do not know much about this\r\nissue.)\r\n \r\n> Is it worth digging into hal to correct this?

I\r\nhave played around a bit with udisks yesterday, it seems to follow the\r\nsame basic concepts as hal. AFAICT, udisks-daemon is simply an upgraded\r\nversion of hald that is specialized on block devices, as one part of a\r\nmore modular approach to hardware abstraction.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nRegards,            |\r\n          Florian   |\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
