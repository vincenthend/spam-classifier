I would like to see the output\nof:\n\n  awk \'/<policy group="plugdev">/,/<\\/policy>/\' /etc/dbus-1/system.d/hal.conf\n\n> Mounting as root on the commandline still works, but it\'s a hassle for\n> the user who wants to simple use their usb stick.\n\nIt would be interesting to know if regular users can mount USB sticks\nusing pmount or pmount-hal on the command line. \n\n> And the UUID of the usb stick is even listed in /etc/fstab so that it is\n> supposed to mount automatically when plugged in (though that does not\n> seem to work). But that may be an unrelated issue.\n\nAFAIK, you should not have any entries in fstab for removable devices\nthat you want to be handled by KDE/Gnome/whatever_other_DE via the\ndbus/hal mechanism. In any case, I would avoid trying to mix different\napproaches.\n\n> Another (possibly also unrelated) issue is that when several X are\n> running (different users, all with KDE) then it seems that only one of\n> them can mount and unmount, usually the wrong user.\n\nI have seen that complaint before, also for systems on which mounting\nworked perfectly for single-user sessions, and I am not sure if a\nsatisfactory solution exists. (I have no need for running multiple KDE\nsessions on the same machine, therefore I do not know much about this\nissue.)\n \n> Is it worth digging into hal to correct this?

I\nhave played around a bit with udisks yesterday, it seems to follow the\nsame basic concepts as hal. AFAICT, udisks-daemon is simply an upgraded\nversion of hald that is specialized on block devices, as one part of a\nmore modular approach to hardware abstraction.\n\n-- \nRegards,            |\n          Florian   |\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
