I\'ve blocked telnet and some irrelevant ICMP for a long time. It =\r\ndawned on me the other day that I couldn\'t think of any reason not to =\r\njust drop all TCP and UDP traffic to the router\'s outside IP.\r\n\r\n> Are you running any sort of routing protocol=20\r\n> or similar that communicates with your ISP\'s routers, including things =\r\nlike=20\r\n> MPLS, or any VPNs/tunnels that terminate at the border router?\r\n\r\nNo routing protocols on the outside interface. The VPNs are handled by a =\r\nhost in the DMZ. To this router, the VPN traffic looks like just more =\r\nUDP between public IPs.\r\n\r\n> What about NAT=20\r\n> or port forwarding on the border router?\r\n\r\nThere\'s no port forwarding, and NAT all happens inside, on the firewall =\r\nthat connects the outside, the DMZ, and the LAN. This router sees only =\r\nmy routable address space (and its IP on the 1918 net between it and the =\r\nfirewall).\r\n\r\n--=20\r\nGlenn English\r\nghe@slsware.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
