{'body': 'Hi,\n\nI recently upgraded most of my KDE programs to the KDE 4 versions, and\nfor one program I regretted it after only a few minutes.  Here is a list\nof the regressions in kaffeine I noticed so far:\n\n- cannot save tracks from an audio CD as .ogg files anymore\n\n- does not display tracks when playing an audio CD, screen is black\n\n- stops playing audio CD after first track\n\n- window size is fixed, videos are resized to fit window size rather\n  than the other way around\n\n- the settings menu is almost empty, nothing to configure anymore\n  apparently\n\n- does not have a manual\n\nI\'m not going to look any further but will rather go back to 0.8.7 and\nput it on hold.  It feels like using an application that is maybe at\nversion 0.2, rather than a 1.0 release candidate.  Given that kaffeine\n0.8 was a quite mature program with lots of features, I find this very\nsad.\n\nRegards,\n        Sven\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-kde-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
