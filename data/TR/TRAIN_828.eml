{'body': 'Hi,\r\n\r\nI recently upgraded most of my KDE programs to the KDE 4 versions, and\r\nfor one program I regretted it after only a few minutes.  Here is a list\r\nof the regressions in kaffeine I noticed so far:\r\n\r\n- cannot save tracks from an audio CD as .ogg files anymore\r\n\r\n- does not display tracks when playing an audio CD, screen is black\r\n\r\n- stops playing audio CD after first track\r\n\r\n- window size is fixed, videos are resized to fit window size rather\r\n  than the other way around\r\n\r\n- the settings menu is almost empty, nothing to configure anymore\r\n  apparently\r\n\r\n- does not have a manual\r\n\r\nI\'m not going to look any further but will rather go back to 0.8.7 and\r\nput it on hold.  It feels like using an application that is maybe at\r\nversion 0.2, rather than a 1.0 release candidate.  Given that kaffeine\r\n0.8 was a quite mature program with lots of features, I find this very\r\nsad.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n        Sven\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-kde-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
