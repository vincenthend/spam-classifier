Saskatchewan, for example, once\nshared with Iceland the distinction of most telephone connections per\ncapita, and for a long time shared the internet penetration lead with\nIceland (Sask is a land-locked massive expanse of ultra-flat dust with\nonly two rivers and farm sizes measured in the\nhundred-thousand-hectares).\n\nIt\'s still curious Iceland leads.  Maybe there\'s just a deep cultural\ncuriousity and fascination with watching advertising from the rest of\nthe world. Maybe they\'re downloading Bjork videos.\n\n-- \nGary Lawrence Murphy <garym@teledyn.com> TeleDynamics Communications Inc\n Business Advantage through Community Software : http://www.teledyn.com\n"Computers are useless.
