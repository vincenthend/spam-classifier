With four drives, wouldn\'t a \nRAID 10 be better use of resources, since you can migrate to bigger \nsetups later?

I believe the discussion degenerated into a nit-picky \nbanter over the general suitability of XFS, but I may be wrong about this...\n\n_____\n\n\nSeriously, ext4 is not suitable if you anticipate possible boot \nproblems, unless you are experienced at these things.  The same is true \nof XFS.   If you *are* experienced, then more power to you.  Although, I \nwould have assumed a very experienced person would have no need to ask \nthe question.\n\nSomeone pointed out what I have come to regard as the best solution, and \nthat is to make /boot and / (root) and the usual suspects ext3 for \nsafety, and use ext4 or XFS or even btrfs for the data directories.\n\n(Unless OP were talking strictly about the data drives to begin with, a \npossibility I admit I may have overlooked.)\n\n\nHave I summarized adequately?\n\n\nMAA\n\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
