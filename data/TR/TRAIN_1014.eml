With four drives, wouldn\'t a \r\nRAID 10 be better use of resources, since you can migrate to bigger \r\nsetups later?  And there we were content to let it lie, until...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>> but the intention is to add more drives as storage requirements\r\n>> increase.\r\n>>\r\n>> My research/googling suggests ext3 supports 16TB volumes if block\r\n>\r\n> Why ext3?

I believe the discussion degenerated into a nit-picky \r\nbanter over the general suitability of XFS, but I may be wrong about this...\r\n\r\n_____\r\n\r\n\r\nSeriously, ext4 is not suitable if you anticipate possible boot \r\nproblems, unless you are experienced at these things.  The same is true \r\nof XFS.   If you *are* experienced, then more power to you.  Although, I \r\nwould have assumed a very experienced person would have no need to ask \r\nthe question.\r\n\r\nSomeone pointed out what I have come to regard as the best solution, and \r\nthat is to make /boot and / (root) and the usual suspects ext3 for \r\nsafety, and use ext4 or XFS or even btrfs for the data directories.\r\n\r\n(Unless OP were talking strictly about the data drives to begin with, a \r\npossibility I admit I may have overlooked.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHave I summarized adequately?\r\n\r\n\r\nMAA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
