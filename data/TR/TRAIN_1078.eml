{'body': "Hi,\n\nI receive the message `Battery is now fully charged' on my Asus EEE\n1000HE under Debian Lenny 5 w. kernel 2.26-2-686, but only once I have\nunplugged the cable? For example, the PC might be on AC power for 15\nhours, and say nothing. If I then unplug the cable, it tells me that the\nbattery is _now_ fully charged. Is it normal? Does someone else\nexperience this?\n\nThanks,\n\n-- \nMerciadri Luca\nSee http://www.student.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/~merciadri/\nI use PGP.
