{'body': "From nobody Fri Sep  7 01:04:37 2018\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\n\nHi,\r\n\r\nI receive the message `Battery is now fully charged' on my Asus EEE\r\n1000HE under Debian Lenny 5 w. kernel 2.26-2-686, but only once I have\r\nunplugged the cable? For example, the PC might be on AC power for 15\r\nhours, and say nothing. If I then unplug the cable, it tells me that the\r\nbattery is _now_ fully charged. Is it normal? Does someone else\r\nexperience this?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n--=20\r\nMerciadri Luca\r\nSee http://www.student.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/~merciadri/\r\nI use PGP. If there is an incompatibility problem with your mail\r\nclient, please contact me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", 'subject': "`Battery is now fully charged:' why do I receive this after having\r\n unplugged the cable?"}
