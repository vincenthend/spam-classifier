See here:\n\n[Bug 218272] New: webshortcuts broken after upgrading KDE 3 to 4 due to \ndecimal in keyword delimiter which krunner doesnt support\n\nhttps://bugs.kde.org/218272\n \n> > Anyway I suggest to file those issues as concrete as possible as bugs\n> > as you manage to take time for it.\n\nI did so really. This bug report contains quite some hints on testing with \nan empty configuration. Its as easy as that:\n\nmkdir ~/.kde-test\nexport KDEHOME=~/.kde-test\n\nThen start your KDE application you want to test with empty settings from \nthis shell. You can also easily see what configuration files the application \nor the subsystems it uses create.\n\nCiao,\n-- \nMartin \'Helios\' Steigerwald - http://www.Lichtvoll.de\nGPG: 03B0 0D6C 0040 0710 4AFA  B82F 991B EAAC A599 84C7\n', 'subject': 'Re: What needs to improve in KDE 4?'}
