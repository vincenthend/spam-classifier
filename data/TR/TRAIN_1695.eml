This bug report contains quite some hints on testing with=\r\n=20\r\nan empty configuration. Its as easy as that:\r\n\r\nmkdir ~/.kde-test\r\nexport KDEHOME=3D~/.kde-test\r\n\r\nThen start your KDE application you want to test with empty settings from=20\r\nthis shell. You can also easily see what configuration files the applicatio=\r\nn=20\r\nor the subsystems it uses create.\r\n\r\nCiao,\r\n=2D-=20\r\nMartin \'Helios\' Steigerwald - http://www.Lichtvoll.de\r\nGPG: 03B0 0D6C 0040 0710 4AFA  B82F 991B EAAC A599 84C7\r\n', 'subject': 'Re: What needs to improve in KDE 4?'}
