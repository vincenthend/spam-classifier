There are *many* reasons not to use pdfLaTeX.\nThey do not enter in the scope of this mailing list, but I am pretty\nsure you will find them directly on the Internet. For example, pdfLaTeX\nencourages one to use directly JPG, etc., for the inclusion in the\ndocument, which is pretty bad. There are also many incompatibilities\nwith different packages.\n\nNote that, under Windows, I remember that acrord32.exe always blocked\nthe file for writing, even if it was only being read by acrord32.exe.\nOkay, it's Windows. Bad memories.\n\n-- \nMerciadri Luca\nSee http://www.student.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/~merciadri/\nI use PGP.
