{'body': "I'm not sure this is the right list to write to... sorry in any case...\n\nI have three different tools (e.g. A, B, C) that use the same package (a \npackage I created).\nIs there a way to put it all in a singe XCode project that creates the \npackage, then A.jar, B.jar and finally C.jar?\nI tried with multiple targets, but it didn't work (may be I forgot to \nset some options?).\n\nAny idea?\n\nMany thanks in advance,\nbest regards,\nlivio.\n _______________________________________________\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
