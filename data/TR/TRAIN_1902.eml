It\'s then used before the\nkernel parses its command line.\n\n> I\'m going to have to try installing Squeeze using extlinux as the boot\n> loader.

Take care to have /boot on an ext2\npartition.\n-- \nGood luck!\nFeri.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe". Trouble?
