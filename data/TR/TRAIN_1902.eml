It\'s then used before the\r\nkernel parses its command line.\r\n\r\n> I\'m going to have to try installing Squeeze using extlinux as the boot\r\n> loader.

Take care to have /boot on an ext2\r\npartition.\r\n-- \r\nGood luck!\r\nFeri.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
