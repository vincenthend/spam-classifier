Finally severe regressions should be=20\r\nfixed. For packaging, README.Debian needs to be written on how to switch DB=\r\n=20\r\nbackends since there won\'t be GUI for it. And when this is done, that akona=\r\ndi=20\r\ncould be considered for stable.\r\n\r\nIn other words, you have to do part of upstream release management work=20\r\nwithout knowing the code well. You can be sure that upstream won\'t be pleas=\r\ned=20\r\nwith Debian releasing unreleased version of akonadi. But maybe you can=20\r\nconvince them otherwise to release earlier to accommodate Debian needs. The=\r\nre=20\r\nis lots of work to be done.\r\n\r\nInitial akonadi trunk packaging is at [1]. I have been using it with SQLite=\r\n=20\r\nfor over a month now. Yet I don\'t use akonadi features extensively (not eve=\r\nn=20\r\naddressbook or korganizer) so I can\'t tell much about quality of the code. =\r\nBut=20\r\nI can tell you that if you don\'t step up, this plan probably won\'t make it.\r\n\r\n1. http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pkg-kde/branches/akonadi-\r\ntrunk/#_branches_akonadi-trunk_\r\n\r\n> >  You started this off on a wrong foot by demanding to accommodate to yo=\r\nur\r\n> >  needs.\r\n>=20\r\n> "Please" is not a demand last time I checked.\r\n>=20\r\n> I think that KMail requiring MySQL to function in Debian stable is a\r\n> problem.

Generally, you need to stop talking and generalizing wh=\r\nat=20\r\nyou don\'t know (like keep claiming that releasing with different versions=20\r\nwasn\'t considered despite obvious proof on the contrary).\r\n\r\n> > > There are a number of solutions to this.

If you want it in, stop ranting and start working on it. Give=\r\n=20\r\nfewer lessons how Debian works and actually do something useful towards you=\r\nr=20\r\ngoal.
