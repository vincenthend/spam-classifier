If \nyou want your pet issue fixed, you have to get akonadi from trunk, build it, \ntest whole Debian\'s KDE 4.4.x *extensively* with it including third party \nakonadi plugins like googledata one. Finally severe regressions should be \nfixed. For packaging, README.Debian needs to be written on how to switch DB \nbackends since there won\'t be GUI for it. And when this is done, that akonadi \ncould be considered for stable.\n\nIn other words, you have to do part of upstream release management work \nwithout knowing the code well. You can be sure that upstream won\'t be pleased \nwith Debian releasing unreleased version of akonadi. But maybe you can \nconvince them otherwise to release earlier to accommodate Debian needs. There \nis lots of work to be done.\n\nInitial akonadi trunk packaging is at [1]. I have been using it with SQLite \nfor over a month now. Yet I don\'t use akonadi features extensively (not even \naddressbook or korganizer) so I can\'t tell much about quality of the code. But \nI can tell you that if you don\'t step up, this plan probably won\'t make it.\n\n1. http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pkg-kde/branches/akonadi-\ntrunk/#_branches_akonadi-trunk_\n\n> >  You started this off on a wrong foot by demanding to accommodate to your\n> >  needs.\n> \n> "Please" is not a demand last time I checked.\n> \n> I think that KMail requiring MySQL to function in Debian stable is a\n> problem.

Generally, you need to stop talking and generalizing what \nyou don\'t know (like keep claiming that releasing with different versions \nwasn\'t considered despite obvious proof on the contrary).\n\n> > > There are a number of solutions to this.

If you want it in, stop ranting and start working on it. Give \nfewer lessons how Debian works and actually do something useful towards your \ngoal. Especially since the lack of technical knowledge or background should \nnot be the problem for you.\n\n-- \nModestas Vainius <modestas@vainius.eu>\n', 'subject': 'Re: KDE 4.4.3 in unstable'}
