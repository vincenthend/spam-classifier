Basically it\'s a plan to store hash sums of\nURLs/phone numbers found in spam in a DNSBL, for apps like SpamAssassin to\nlook up.  A little like spamcop\'s "spamvertized URL" list...\n\n--j.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: DEDICATED SERVERS only $89!\nLinux or FreeBSD, FREE setup, FAST network.
