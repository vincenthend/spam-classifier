{'body': "I've written my Apple Push Notification client code in Java (on my server). I open an SSL socket to Apple with a client-side cert, and push a stream of bytes.\n\nIf part of that stream is mal-formed, as I understand it, Apple closes their end of the connection. Also as I understand it, this is made evident to a C client because the number of bytes written to the socket is 0 (or less than was intended).\n\nHowever, in Java, I'm finding no evidence at all that Apple has stopped accepting push notifications, except that I can see the last notification doesn't go through (I set up a test case with one good and one bad token. By changing the order, I can see it work or not work).\n\nWhat do I need to do to detect this condition in Java? I tried checking that the connection is still open and not half-open after each token, but it always looks good.\n\nTIA,\nRick\n\n _______________________________________________\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
