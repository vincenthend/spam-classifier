{'body': 'Hi,\nThe problem here is that Windows has problems in implementing\n"propper" file locking symantics. On the side of acroread.exe, it\nshould not assume documents are static on disk. Not sure if something\nlike file alteration monitor exists on Windows. What is needed is a\ncross-platform FAM-like library. Any suggestions?\n\nErik Heil\n<eheil1@csmining.org>\n\nOn 5/13/10, Merciadri Luca <Luca.Merciadri@student.ulg.ac.be> wrote:\n> Sven Joachim wrote:\n>> On 2010-05-13 17:04 +0200, Merciadri Luca wrote:\n>>\n>>\n>>> When compiling any .tex document using the route latex -> dvips ->\n>>> ps2pdf, I get a PDF.\n>>>\n>>\n>> This is a rather clumsy way these days.
