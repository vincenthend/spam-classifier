When I install MySQL on a Lenny server it thereafter\nautomatically starts the global /var/lib/mysql MySQL server at boot time.\n\nI thought Akonadi was intended to use a private MySQL server process\nrunning in each users\' home directory and started as needed.  (Maybe\nI misunderstood.)\n\nDoes installing KDE cause a global /var/lib/mysql MySQL server to run on\neach workstation, even when nobody is logged in?\n\n--Mike Bird\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-kde-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
