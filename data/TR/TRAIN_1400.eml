At the moment it maybe just being picked up as a mass\nstorage device and not a modem if you still using the 2.6.26 kernel.\nAnd if you want to stay with the 2.6.26 kernel you will have to\ninstall usb-modeswitch[3].\n\nSetting up wvdial this might help you[2].\n\n\nRegards\nDale\n\n[1] http://backports.org/dokuwiki/doku.php\n[2] http://quail.southernvaleslug.org/webblog/archives/136\n[3] http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/\n-- \n[WWW] http://quail.southernvaleslug.org/\n"The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level\nof thinking we were at when we created them" - Albert Einstein\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
