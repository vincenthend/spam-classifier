At the moment it maybe just being picked up as a mass\r\nstorage device and not a modem if you still using the 2.6.26 kernel.\r\nAnd if you want to stay with the 2.6.26 kernel you will have to\r\ninstall usb-modeswitch[3].\r\n\r\nSetting up wvdial this might help you[2].\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nDale\r\n\r\n[1] http://backports.org/dokuwiki/doku.php\r\n[2] http://quail.southernvaleslug.org/webblog/archives/136\r\n[3] http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/\r\n--=20\r\n[WWW] http://quail.southernvaleslug.org/\r\n"The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level\r\nof thinking we were at when we created them" - Albert Einstein\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
