It\'s an observation\nnot a judgement, comment, approval.  You\'ve focused on the\nword "muddy" to use it in a different context than the one\nI posted.\n\nMaybe the distinction I was trying to make was too subtle and\nI was trying to be too clever with my writing this morning.\nLet me summarize the important parts of my post for you: I\nhave a premise that there is a difference between free and protected\nspeech and action.  I think O\'Neill on his soapbox doesn\'t\nunderstand the distinction.\n\nAll better?  \n\nGreg\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: A moment of silence for the First Amendment (fwd)'}
