Nah! (that was the\nwhole point of XML afterall, to sell more CPUs - much like Oracle\'s use of\nJava allows them to sell 3x more CPU licenses due to the performance hit)\n\n> In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount\n> importance in the world of XML.\n>\n> "Today\'s firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only," Kelly\n> said.
