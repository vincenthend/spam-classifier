Just got a video box, cut air holes\nand a hole for the cables, then got an extra-long 2.5" to 3.5" IDE cable,\nand connected it up. Had to make a few holes in the A1200 case for the\nIDE cable too.\n\n Worked a charm. Until I dropped the disk one day onto concrete.\n\nKate\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users\' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: [ILUG] Using Normal IDE Device with a Dell Latitude CPx laptop'}
