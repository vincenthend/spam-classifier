I am using btrfs, and there wer=\r\ne=20\r\nsome issues during the install, but I do not believe I have suffered any fi=\r\nle=20\r\nsystem corruption in the dpkg databse or the aptitude package.\r\n\r\nIn particular, (debsums -a aptitude) reports all the files are in good=20\r\ncondition.  (update-alternatives --display aptitude) shows:\r\nNo alternatives for aptitude.\r\n\r\nI initially installed 0.4.11.11-1~lenny1 on this system, but have since=20\r\nupgraded to 0.6.1.5-3.  Is there a good way for me to establish an alternat=\r\nive=20\r\nthat will not mess up on the next upgrade?  Or, is this problem supposedly=\r\n=20\r\nfixed in 0.6.2.1-2 and I should just upgrade now?\r\n=2D-=20\r\nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr.           \t ,=3D ,-_-. =3D.\r\nbss@iguanasuicide.net            \t((_/)o o(\\_))\r\nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy \t `-\'(. .)`-\'\r\nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/        \t     \\_/\r\n', 'subject': 'Re: Aptitude From Testing'}
