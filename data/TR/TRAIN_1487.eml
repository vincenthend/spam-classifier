I am using btrfs, and there were \nsome issues during the install, but I do not believe I have suffered any file \nsystem corruption in the dpkg databse or the aptitude package.\n\nIn particular, (debsums -a aptitude) reports all the files are in good \ncondition.  (update-alternatives --display aptitude) shows:\nNo alternatives for aptitude.\n\nI initially installed 0.4.11.11-1~lenny1 on this system, but have since \nupgraded to 0.6.1.5-3.  Is there a good way for me to establish an alternative \nthat will not mess up on the next upgrade?  Or, is this problem supposedly \nfixed in 0.6.2.1-2 and I should just upgrade now?\n-- \nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr.           \t ,= ,-_-. =.\nbss@iguanasuicide.net            \t((_/)o o(\\_))\nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy \t `-'(. .)`-'\nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/        \t     \\_/\n", 'subject': 'Re: Aptitude From Testing'}
