Are you saying that whoever has the loudest voice gets to be heard?\nShouting down a public speaker could be considered a form of censorship. If\nshouting down public speakers is 'protected' it is only a matter of time\nbefore the people doing the shouting have their tactic used against\nthem -every single time they open their mouth-. The tactic is stupid and\nnon-productive and if generally used, will only result in chaos.  The tactic\nis just stupid ego-bation at best, unless the goal is to generate chaos.\nAnd humans whose goals and actions in life are to create chaos in society\nshould be locked up (provided you can accurately identify them, which is not\nreally possible anyway, but hey, this is my rant :-). IMHO.\n\nBill\n\n\n", 'subject': 'RE: Re[4]: A moment of silence for the First Amendment (fwd)'}
