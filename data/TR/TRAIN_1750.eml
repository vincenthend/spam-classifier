IMO.  The fact that the\nword "beta" appears in the middle of some introductory text on the front\npage is hardly a valid argument.  (Well accepted software design "fact":\nUSERS DON\'T READ *ANYTHING*)\n\nI get the impression that Vipul & co are deliberately trying to mislead\nusers into downloading the dev code in order to get more unwitting test\nsites.\n\nBut that\'s just my opinion, I could be wrong.\n\nrOD.\n\n--\nAnyway... long story short...\n...is a phrase whose origins are complicated and rambling.\n\n>> Doing the blogging thang again at http://www.groovymother.com/ <<\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nRazor-users mailing list\nRazor-users@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-users\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: [Razor-users] Authentication Error'}
