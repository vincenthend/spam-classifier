{'body': '\r\nI\'m looking for a good battery charge/discharge profiler tool for my=20\r\nUbuntu laptop. I\'m aware that there\'s the "Power History" tool, but it=20\r\ndoesn\'t seem to do what I\'m after. I\'ll explain....\r\n\r\nA couple of years ago, I came across a really neat tool for Windows for=20\r\nestimating the time remaining until the battery is completely charged or =\r\n\r\ndischarged. It was pretty clever about how it went about it. It would=20\r\nconstantly record things like: how much charge the battery said it still =\r\n\r\nhad, how much the battery said it was charging/discharging at, etc. The=20\r\ntool would use this info to estimate the time to charge/discharge...=20\r\n/but/ it also went one step further. It could account for errors in the=20\r\nbattery\'s reporting. For example, if the battery reported that it had=20\r\n80% charge left, and then, a few minutes later, reported that it had=20\r\njust 20% left, then this tool would learn this, and realize that the=20\r\nbattery was old/problematic. So, the /next/ time the battery was=20\r\nreporting 80% charge left, the tool would know not to give too=20\r\noptimistic of an estimate for the remaining time. In other words, the=20\r\ntool was learning what "80%" /really/ meant to that battery.\r\n\r\nIt also did something else which was really cool. Because the battery=20\r\ndrains at different rates depending upon what you\'re doing with your=20\r\nlaptop (ie, playing a DVD on a bright screen versus just reading some=20\r\ntext on a dimmer screen), this tool would actually show you "best case"=20\r\nand "worst case" predictions of your remaining battery life (or time to=20\r\ncharge back up) based upon /actual/ discharge rates from /that level/ of =\r\n\r\nbattery charge remaining that it had experienced on /that/ laptop. So,=20\r\nyou\'d open up the little power-discharge graph tool and you\'d see three=20\r\nlines: a best, a worst, and one in-between which was what rate you\'re=20\r\ncurrently at.\r\n\r\nSo, two questions:\r\n1 - Does anyone know what tool that was? (Yes, I know this is a Linux=20\r\nforum but, as long as I\'m describing the tool, I figured I\'d ask. It\'s=20\r\nnot the PassMark one. I thought it was called BatMon or something, but=20\r\nnow I can\'t find it anywhere).\r\n2 - Does anybody know of a tool that does this in Linux? Or, is there=20\r\nsome way to get the Gnome power-history tool to show this kind of stuff?\r\n\r\n- Joe\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
