{'body': '\nI\'m looking for a good battery charge/discharge profiler tool for my \nUbuntu laptop. I\'m aware that there\'s the "Power History" tool, but it \ndoesn\'t seem to do what I\'m after. I\'ll explain....\n\nA couple of years ago, I came across a really neat tool for Windows for \nestimating the time remaining until the battery is completely charged or \ndischarged. It was pretty clever about how it went about it. It would \nconstantly record things like: how much charge the battery said it still \nhad, how much the battery said it was charging/discharging at, etc. The \ntool would use this info to estimate the time to charge/discharge... \n/but/ it also went one step further. It could account for errors in the \nbattery\'s reporting. For example, if the battery reported that it had \n80% charge left, and then, a few minutes later, reported that it had \njust 20% left, then this tool would learn this, and realize that the \nbattery was old/problematic. So, the /next/ time the battery was \nreporting 80% charge left, the tool would know not to give too \noptimistic of an estimate for the remaining time. In other words, the \ntool was learning what "80%" /really/ meant to that battery.\n\nIt also did something else which was really cool. Because the battery \ndrains at different rates depending upon what you\'re doing with your \nlaptop (ie, playing a DVD on a bright screen versus just reading some \ntext on a dimmer screen), this tool would actually show you "best case" \nand "worst case" predictions of your remaining battery life (or time to \ncharge back up) based upon /actual/ discharge rates from /that level/ of \nbattery charge remaining that it had experienced on /that/ laptop. So, \nyou\'d open up the little power-discharge graph tool and you\'d see three \nlines: a best, a worst, and one in-between which was what rate you\'re \ncurrently at.\n\nSo, two questions:\n1 - Does anyone know what tool that was? (Yes, I know this is a Linux \nforum but, as long as I\'m describing the tool, I figured I\'d ask. It\'s \nnot the PassMark one. I thought it was called BatMon or something, but \nnow I can\'t find it anywhere).\n2 - Does anybody know of a tool that does this in Linux? Or, is there \nsome way to get the Gnome power-history tool to show this kind of stuff?\n\n- Joe\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
