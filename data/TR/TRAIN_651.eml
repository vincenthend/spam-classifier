It was removed yesterday by members of Kilburn White Horse\nAssociation, who found a Countryside Alliance badge attached to the carpet.\nJohn Roberts of the association said: "It has obviously been very well\norganised. It was a well crafted piece of kit: a figure of a huntsman with a\nhorn cut out of carpets.\n"It was big and impressive and could be seen for miles about. They tied it\nto bushes at the top and nailed it down. It caused all the stone chippings\nto be pushed downwards, which will help turn the white horse grey. It will\nnot get another refit for another year.\n"Whoever did it must have come with a vehicle  a tractor and trailer or a\nlorry  because the carpet must have come in one piece. It was extremely\nwell planned and took several people an hour and a half to get it off."\nThe sculpture needs constant work because, unlike chalk horses in the south\nof England, it is cut into limestone which is the wrong colour and needs\nwhitening.\nMr Roberts added: "The damage as such is not great but it adds to the\ndeterioration, which means it will need more work next time.\n"We would have more sympathy if, having made the point, they would come to\ntake it away again because it was a major job."\nAndy Wilson, chief executive of the North York Moors National Park, said:\n"It is a scheduled ancient monument and the local residents are very proud\nof it and go to enormous trouble to keep it white. There is also careful\nconsideration of what shape it should be kept with the constant growth of\nvegetation so you can understand the alarm and regret at any changes. There\nhas not been a cut in the turf  which would be much more of a problem. It\nwould seem it was carefully plotted beforehand."\nAn RCA spokesman said: "Some people in the country are getting very\nfrustrated at the inaction. All we want is Ministers to take notice. Marches\ndon\'t seem to be doing anything good."\nThe Countryside Alliance said it did not have any part in the action.\nSpokesman Adrian Yelland said: "The Countryside Alliance only ever advocates\ncampaigning that is lawful and dissociates itself from acts of vandalism and\nregrets any damage that may have been caused by this incident."\nThe incident follows graffiti on road signs and motorway bridges in\nYorkshire thought to be RCA work.\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
