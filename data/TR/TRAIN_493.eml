You ought to \'cvs update\' and see if \nyour issue becomes any clearer with all the brush removed.\n\nMy patch notes that \'msgid\' and \'line\' are redundant with one another and removes \none or the other from functions which takes both.  The callers are then \nchanged to pass what the function expects.  In the case of Msg_Change, the \n\'line\' argument is removed and we only have the msgid argument.  Ftoc_ClearCurrent\nis now the first line of MsgChange.\n\nChris\n\n-- \nChris Garrigues                 http://www.DeepEddy.Com/~cwg/\nvirCIO                          http://www.virCIO.Com\n716 Congress, Suite 200\nAustin, TX  78701\t\t+1 512 374 0500\n\n  World War III:  The Wrong-Doers Vs. the Evil-Doers.\n\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: Another bug'}
