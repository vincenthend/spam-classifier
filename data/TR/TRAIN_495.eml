It is usually lazy mantainer or dead\r\nupstream which delay such fixes.  Upstream fix should likely be around\r\nif someone fixed that for stable.\r\n\r\n> There are also no Debian Security Advisories \r\n> (DSA) for issues that are present in the unstable version of a software, \r\n> but not the versions in stable and/or testing.\r\n\r\nI see... I now think placing pointer to FAQ should be good idea to\r\nexplain all these issues.\r\n\r\nI need to think think about the context of these.  This was in\r\nsection describing "archive".  (I have other place where I say "For your\r\n**production server**, the `stable` suite with the security updates is\r\nrecommended.")  \r\n\r\nSo I am updating as:\r\n\r\nTIP: If "`sid`" is used in the above example instead of\r\n"`@-@codename-stable@-@`", the "`deb: http://security.debian.org/ ...`"\r\nline for security updates in the "`/etc/apt/sources.list`" is not\r\nrequired.   This is because there is no security update archive for\r\n"`sid`" (`unstable`).\r\n\r\nNOTE: The security bugs for the `stable` archive are fixed by the Debian\r\nsecurity team.  This activity has been quite rigorous and reliable.\r\nThose for the `testing` archive may be fixed by the Debian testing\r\nsecurity team.  For several reasons, this activity is not as rigorous as\r\nthat for `stable` and you may need to wait for the migration of fixed\r\n`unstable` packages.  Those for the `unstable` archive are fixed by the\r\nindividual maintainer.  Actively maintained `unstable` packages are\r\nusually in a fairly good shape by leveraging latest upstream security\r\nfixes. See http://www.debian.org/security/faq[Debian security FAQ]\r\nfor how Debian handles security bugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
