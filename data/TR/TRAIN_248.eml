Population estimates vary wildly and about all\nyour average skeptic can do is take geometric means to get ballpark\nfigures.  While Central America may have had 20 or 30 million, vast\nareas of South America were uninhabited and other places very\nsparsely e.g., the plains Indians in what is now the U.S. may have\nbeen 2 million or so.\n\nThere are those who claim that the Mexican population declined from\n20 something million to circa 8 or 10 million in the 16th century,\ncertainly, in part due to infectious diseases new and old, and other\nfactors, and was probably in decline before contact.  Others claim it\ndeclined from 80-ish million to 3 or 4 million and somehow deduce 95%\nmortality from imported diseases, and have a pretty clear agenda which\nmakes me (for one) take their claims with a large grain of salt.\n\nAbout all that is certain is that anyone alive in 1500 was dead in 1600,\nin the Americas or elsewhere.\n\nR\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n", 'subject': "Re: Al'Qaeda's fantasy ideology: Policy Review no. 114"}
