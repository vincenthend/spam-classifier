It certainly adds some nice syntactic\nsugar, and is apparently much faster for certain types of complex\nrulesets.  It will be good once it\'s had some time to settle down a\nlittle.\n\n>>i\'ve no experience of ipfw.

It\nhas some nice features like the ability to save and restore state so\nthat connections are persistent across reboots, and its logging is\nmarginally better organised than ipfw\'s.  It\'s also very mature code,\nwhich appeals to the rather conservative tastes of my old age.\n\nNick\n\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users\' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: [ILUG] ipfw vs ipchains vs iptables'}
