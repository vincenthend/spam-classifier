Up till this point, I haven\'t logged in to gnome.\r\n\r\nBut the key is restarting the X server, not necessarily a logout and\r\nlogin to the GNOME desktop.  A login/logout sequence is simply the most\r\ncommon way to restart the X server.  The X server can only start once\r\nsafely.  After that, who knows what VT it will end up on, and what parts\r\nof the old instance of the server will get terminated.  Has anyone seen\r\nsomething like this on a non-Nvidia driver (not nv and not nvidia)?\r\n\r\n-- \r\n  .\'\'`.
