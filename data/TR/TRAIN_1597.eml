I have remove the PCI-E card and\r\nthe machine was able to detect the onboard VGA chipset (using module\r\nradeonhd).\r\n\r\nAt the moment, when I boot, I get 1024x768 resolution on both of them\r\n(monitor and TV) with both showing the same image. I have tried to\r\ncreate an xorg.conf using\r\nhttp://wiki.debian.org/XStrikeForce/HowToRandR12 but it is not being\r\napplied (both outputs have 1024x768 resolution even though I have\r\nspecified the preferred resolution in xorg.con). Does anyone see obvious\r\nmistakes in the file or if I have missed something?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKS.\r\nPS: I just realized that I could have used a DVD-HDMI adapter for my\r\nNvidia 8600GTS card too. However, its fan is really noisy :(\r\n\r\n--------------\r\nSection "Module"\r\n        #Load    "bitmap"\r\n        #Load    "dbe"\r\n        #Load    "ddc"\r\n        #Load   "dri"\r\n        #Load    "extmod"\r\n        #Load    "freetype"\r\n        #Load    "int10"\r\n        #Load    "record"\r\n        #Load   "type1"\r\n        #Load    "vbe"\r\nEndSection\r\n\r\nSection "InputDevice"\r\n        Identifier      "Generic Keyboard"\r\n        Driver          "kbd"\r\n        Option          "XkbRules"      "xorg"\r\n        Option          "XkbModel"      "pc104"\r\n        Option          "XkbLayout"     "us"\r\nEndSection\r\n\r\nSection "InputDevice"\r\n        Identifier      "Configured Mouse"\r\n        Driver          "mouse"\r\n        Option          "CorePointer"\r\n        Option          "Device"                "/dev/input/mice"\r\n        Option          "Protocol"              "ImPS/2"\r\n        Option          "Buttons"               "7"\r\n        Option          "ZAxisMapping"          "4 5"\r\n        Option          "ButtonMapping"         "1 2 3 6 7 4 5"\r\nEndSection\r\n\r\nSection "Device"\r\n        Identifier      "ATI Technologies Inc Radeon HD 3300 Graphics"\r\n        Driver          "radeonhd"\r\n#       BusID           "01:05.0"\r\n        Option          "AccelMethod"   "EXA"\r\n        Option          "Monitor-VGA-0" "Lenovo Monitor"\r\n        Option          "Monitor-HDMI-0" "External TV"\r\n        Option          "Audio" "on"\r\n        Option          "HDMI" "all"\r\nEndSection\r\n\r\nSection "Monitor"\r\n        Identifier      "Lenovo Monitor"\r\n        Modeline        "1920x1200_60.00"  193.16  1920 2048 2256 2592\r\n1200 1201 1204 1242  -HSync +Vsync\r\n        Option          "PreferredMode" "1920x1200_60.00"\r\nEndSection\r\n\r\nSection "Monitor"\r\n        Identifier      "External TV"\r\n        DisplaySize     1600 900\r\n        Modeline        "1360x768_60.00"  84.72  1360 1424 1568 1776\r\n768 769 772 795  -HSync +Vsync\r\n        Option          "PreferredMode" "1360x768_60.00"\r\n        Option          "RightOf" "Lenovo Monitor"\r\nEndSection\r\n\r\nSection "Screen"\r\n        Identifier      "Big Screen"\r\n        Device          "ATI Technologies Inc Radeon HD 3300 Graphics"\r\n        DefaultDepth    24\r\n        SubSection      "Display"\r\n                Depth           24\r\n                #Virtual Screen size add widths + max(height of monitor)\r\nfor right+left config\r\n                Virtual         3280 1200\r\n        EndSubSection\r\nEndSection\r\n\r\nSection "ServerLayout"\r\n        Identifier      "Default Layout"\r\n        Screen          "Big Screen"\r\n        InputDevice     "Generic Keyboard"\r\n        InputDevice     "Configured Mouse"\r\nEndSection\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
