I have remove the PCI-E card and\nthe machine was able to detect the onboard VGA chipset (using module\nradeonhd).\n\nAt the moment, when I boot, I get 1024x768 resolution on both of them\n(monitor and TV) with both showing the same image. I have tried to\ncreate an xorg.conf using\nhttp://wiki.debian.org/XStrikeForce/HowToRandR12 but it is not being\napplied (both outputs have 1024x768 resolution even though I have\nspecified the preferred resolution in xorg.con). Does anyone see obvious\nmistakes in the file or if I have missed something?\n\nThanks,\nKS.\nPS: I just realized that I could have used a DVD-HDMI adapter for my\nNvidia 8600GTS card too. However, its fan is really noisy :(\n\n--------------\nSection "Module"\n        #Load    "bitmap"\n        #Load    "dbe"\n        #Load    "ddc"\n        #Load   "dri"\n        #Load    "extmod"\n        #Load    "freetype"\n        #Load    "int10"\n        #Load    "record"\n        #Load   "type1"\n        #Load    "vbe"\nEndSection\n\nSection "InputDevice"\n        Identifier      "Generic Keyboard"\n        Driver          "kbd"\n        Option          "XkbRules"      "xorg"\n        Option          "XkbModel"      "pc104"\n        Option          "XkbLayout"     "us"\nEndSection\n\nSection "InputDevice"\n        Identifier      "Configured Mouse"\n        Driver          "mouse"\n        Option          "CorePointer"\n        Option          "Device"                "/dev/input/mice"\n        Option          "Protocol"              "ImPS/2"\n        Option          "Buttons"               "7"\n        Option          "ZAxisMapping"          "4 5"\n        Option          "ButtonMapping"         "1 2 3 6 7 4 5"\nEndSection\n\nSection "Device"\n        Identifier      "ATI Technologies Inc Radeon HD 3300 Graphics"\n        Driver          "radeonhd"\n#       BusID           "01:05.0"\n        Option          "AccelMethod"   "EXA"\n        Option          "Monitor-VGA-0" "Lenovo Monitor"\n        Option          "Monitor-HDMI-0" "External TV"\n        Option          "Audio" "on"\n        Option          "HDMI" "all"\nEndSection\n\nSection "Monitor"\n        Identifier      "Lenovo Monitor"\n        Modeline        "1920x1200_60.00"  193.16  1920 2048 2256 2592\n1200 1201 1204 1242  -HSync +Vsync\n        Option          "PreferredMode" "1920x1200_60.00"\nEndSection\n\nSection "Monitor"\n        Identifier      "External TV"\n        DisplaySize     1600 900\n        Modeline        "1360x768_60.00"  84.72  1360 1424 1568 1776\n768 769 772 795  -HSync +Vsync\n        Option          "PreferredMode" "1360x768_60.00"\n        Option          "RightOf" "Lenovo Monitor"\nEndSection\n\nSection "Screen"\n        Identifier      "Big Screen"\n        Device          "ATI Technologies Inc Radeon HD 3300 Graphics"\n        DefaultDepth    24\n        SubSection      "Display"\n                Depth           24\n                #Virtual Screen size add widths + max(height of monitor)\nfor right+left config\n                Virtual         3280 1200\n        EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nSection "ServerLayout"\n        Identifier      "Default Layout"\n        Screen          "Big Screen"\n        InputDevice     "Generic Keyboard"\n        InputDevice     "Configured Mouse"\nEndSection\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
