The master\r\npenguin himself, kernel.org, has run on XFS since 2008.  Sorry for the body\r\nslam.  Is your back ok Mark? ;)  Pretty sure I just "won" this discussion.\r\nErr, actually, XFS wins. ;)  BTW, the main Debian mirror in the U.S. is\r\nactually housed in kernel.org last I checked.  Thus, the files on your\r\nsystem were very likely originally served from XFS.\r\n\r\n The Linux Kernel Archives\r\n\r\n"A bit more than a year ago (as of October 2008) kernel.org, in an ever\r\nincreasing need to squeeze more performance out of it\'s machines, made the\r\nleap of migrating the primary mirror machines (mirrors.kernel.org) to XFS.\r\nWe site a number of reasons including fscking 5.5T of disk is long and\r\npainful, we were hitting various cache issues, and we were seeking better\r\nperformance out of our file system."\r\n\r\n"After initial tests looked positive we made the jump, and have been quite\r\nhappy with the results. With an instant increase in performance and\r\nthroughput, as well as the worst xfs_check we\'ve ever seen taking 10\r\nminutes, we were quite happy. Subsequently we\'ve moved all primary mirroring\r\nfile-systems to XFS, including www.kernel.org , and mirrors.kernel.org. With\r\nan average constant movement of about 400mbps around the world, and with\r\npeaks into the 3.1gbps range serving thousands of users simultaneously it\'s\r\nbeen a file system that has taken the brunt we can throw at it and held up\r\nspectacularly."\r\n\r\nhttp://www.xfs.org/index.php/XFS_Companies#The_Linux_Kernel_Archives\r\n\r\n-- \r\nStan\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
