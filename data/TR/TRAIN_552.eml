What \ndist are you running ? I don't think there's an athalon-redhat-linux \nmachine as standard ;) it should be some permutation of athlon and linux, \nand without redhat, but I can't tell for sure.   Any idea where your \nsystem might be setting this flag ?\n\n\n > RPM build errors:\n>     user jkeating does not exist - using root\n>     group jkeating does not exist - using root\n>     user jkeating does not exist - using root\n>     group jkeating does not exist - using root\n>     Bad exit status from /home/dale/rpmbuild/tmp/rpm-tmp.26673 (%prep)\n\nlooks like the files are owned by the wrong user (ie the original spec \nbuilder).\n\nThomas\n\n-- \n\nThe Dave/Dina Project : future TV today ! - http://davedina.apestaart.org/\n<-*-                      -*->\nGoodbye\nI've finally arrived\n<-*- thomas@apestaart.org -*->\nURGent, the best radio on the Internet - 24/7 ! - http://urgent.rug.ac.be/\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n", 'subject': 'Re: K3B'}
