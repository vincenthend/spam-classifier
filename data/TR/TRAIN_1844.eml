Then of course, the data that has been\nwritten needs to be used for something such as fulfillment and analysis.\nBoth are mostly reads.  Backup from the live DB is all reads.\n\nI typically saw about 90% reads in OLTP databases.\n\nI think this is getting off-topic for debian-user.\n\n--Mike Bird\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
