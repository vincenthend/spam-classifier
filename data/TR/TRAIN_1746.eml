A comprehensive list of\nmirrors is available at:\n\n    <http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist>\n\nPlease note that the oldstable distribution will be moved from the main\narchive to the archive.debian.org repository after June 6th 2010.\nAfter this move, it will no longer be available from the main mirror\nnetwork.  More information about the distribution archive and a list of\nmirrors is available at:\n\n    <http://www.debian.org/distrib/archive>\n\n\nMiscellaneous Bugfixes\n----------------------\n\nThis oldstable update adds a few important corrections to the following\npackages:\n\n    Package                                      Reason\n\n    backup-manager         Fix disclosure of MySQL passwords to local users\n    binutils               Add mips support for ".set symbol,value" gas syntax\n    fam                    Fix 100% CPU usage in famd\n    fetchmail              Fix potential MITM against APOP and potential DoS\n    freedoom               Remove copyright-violating material\n    glibc                  Fix incorrect libc6-amd64 dependency\n    gnupg                  Fix memory leak and cleanup terminal on interrupt\n    irssi                  Fix out of bounds access\n    kazehakase             Disallow adding bookmarks for data:/javascript: URIs\n    linux-2.6              Several vulnerabilities\n    linux-2.6.24           Several vulnerabilities\n    mksh                   Fix unauthenticated local privilege escalation\n    mt-daapd               Update the embedded prototype.js to fix security issues\n    openafs                Don\'t create invalid pointers to kernel memory when handling errors\n    openssl                Deprecate MD2 hash signatures and fix several DoS vulnerabilities\n    serveez                Fix remote buffer overflow\n    tetex-bin              Don\'t fail when LaTeX is more than five years old\n    texlive-bin            Don\'t fail when LaTeX is more than five years old\n    texlive-extra          Don\'t fail when LaTeX is more than five years old\n    texlive-lang           Don\'t fail when LaTeX is more than five years old\n    wordpress              Fix DoS via long title and specially constructed charset parameter\n    xcftools               Fix crash with files containing negative co-ordinates\n\n\nDebian Installer\n----------------\n\nThe Debian Installer has been updated in this point release to offer\nbetter support for installation of the "oldstable" distribution and\nfrom archive.debian.org and to resolve issues with checking the GPG\nsignatures of some files on mirror servers.\n\nThe kernel image used by the installer has been updated to incorporate\na number of important and security-related fixes.\n\n\nSecurity Updates\n----------------\n\nThis revision adds the following security updates to the oldstable\nrelease.

release due to a mismatch between the\nupstream tarball used for the security update and that already present\nin the oldstable distribution.\n\n\nRemoved packages\n----------------\n\nThe following packages were removed due to circumstances beyond our\ncontrol:\n\n    Package                                Reason\n\n    destar                                 Security issues\n    libclass-dbi-loader-relationship-perl  License problems\n    libhdate-pascal                        [source:hdate] Licensing issues\n    loop-aes-modules-2.6-sparc32           [source:loop-aes] Corresponding source / kernel no longer in the archive\n    loop-aes-modules-2.6-sparc64           [source:loop-aes] Corresponding source / kernel no longer in the archive\n    loop-aes-modules-2.6-sparc64-smp       [source:loop-aes] Corresponding source / kernel no longer in the archive\n    loop-aes-modules-2.6-vserver-sparc64   [source:loop-aes] Corresponding source / kernel no longer in the archive\n    rails                                  Security and usability issues\n\nA few further packages were removed as a result, as they depend on\nlibclass-dbi-loader-relationship-perl; these packages are:\n\n    maypole\n    maypole-authentication-usersession-cookie\n    maypole-plugin-upload\n    memories\n\n\nAdditionally those parts of the libwww-search-perl and\nlibperl4caml-ocaml-dev packages which rely on the Google SOAP search\nAPI (provided by libnet-google-perl) are no longer functional as the\nAPI has been retired by Google.  The remaining portions of the packages\nwill continue to function as before.\n\n\nAbout Debian\n------------\n\nThe Debian project is an organisation of Free Software developers who\nvolunteer their time and effort, collaborating via the Internet.
