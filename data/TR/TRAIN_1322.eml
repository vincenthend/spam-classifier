I thought it was odd that someone\nwanted to send the MIME blurb to the list, but it was not really that\ndifferent from causing the New York Times web site to send a story to\nthe list.  (Except that the bits here are antediluvian, but old bits are\na problem to be solved by social opporobrium, not technical constraints.)\n\nBut I think what actually happened is that some idiot got infected by\nKlez and had both FoRK and the pine-robot autoresponder address in their\nmailbox or addressbook, so Klez forged mail from fork@xent.com to the\nautoresponder, which responded.  To FoRK.\n\n", 'subject': 'Re: The MIME information you requested (last changed 3154 Feb 14)'}
