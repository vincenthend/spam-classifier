That means that there is a not backward compatible modification in Java 6 that triggers that problem. No need to have a BS in computer science to parse that.\n\n> Anyway, the main thread here really is about slow performance, not about Glyph rendering.\n\nAnd glyph rendering affects performance. And it is likely that other modifications in Java 6 similarly affect performance for other areas. Are you being a troll ?\n\n\nJean-Christophe Helary\n----------------------------------------\nfun: http://mac4translators.blogspot.com\nwork: http://www.doublet.jp (ja/en > fr)\ntweets: http://twitter.com/brandelune\n\n _______________________________________________\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
