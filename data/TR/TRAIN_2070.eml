That means that there is a not backward =\r\ncompatible modification in Java 6 that triggers that problem. No need to =\r\nhave a BS in computer science to parse that.\r\n\r\n> Anyway, the main thread here really is about slow performance, not =\r\nabout Glyph rendering.\r\n\r\nAnd glyph rendering affects performance. And it is likely that other =\r\nmodifications in Java 6 similarly affect performance for other areas. =\r\nAre you being a troll ?\r\n\r\n\r\nJean-Christophe Helary\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nfun: http://mac4translators.blogspot.com\r\nwork: http://www.doublet.jp (ja/en > fr)\r\ntweets: http://twitter.com/brandelune\r\n\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
