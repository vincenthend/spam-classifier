I am using Debian Lenny x6=\r\n4 with the grub2 bootloader.\r\n\r\nThis might sound like an easy question=2C but does the Linux kernel module =\r\nhave to be compiled with the running kernel in order to log messages at boo=\r\nt time? I mean obviously the driver is required to be loaded in Debian GNU/=\r\nLinux when the serial/com device is used in conjunction\r\nwith /dev/ttyD[01].\r\n\r\nI have found a website providing patches for the chip on the PCI serial car=\r\nd I am using at:\r\nhttp://izto.org/mcs9865/\r\n\r\nDoes Debian not include drivers for serial cards in any packages or would t=\r\nhese drivers be considered non-free?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n=20\r\n\r\n-M\r\n\r\n\r\n \t\t \t   \t\t =20\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\nVideos that have everyone talking!
