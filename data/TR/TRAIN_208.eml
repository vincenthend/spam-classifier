I pointed out that the\nidea that a BIOS could change a filesystem\'s superblock didn\'t make\nany sense and that it could not be a UUID problem because he could\nboot boxes with Intel mobos but not boxes with another manufacturer\'s\nmobos (I assume that he could have replied that the other mobos were\nchanging the UUIDs and the Intels ones not...).\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
