Even "unseen" can be changed (fortunately that one\nis easy to find in the MH profile - though whether exmh does that,\nos just uses "unseen" I haven\'t bothered to find out).\n\nkre\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: New Sequences Window'}
