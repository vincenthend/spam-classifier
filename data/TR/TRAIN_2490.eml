Seems like every CD player should include the\ncapability to rip, encode, and cache the last few CDs \ninserted. \n\nPlayback would then never need to face seek delays... \nafter the initial ripping, the only use of the laser \npickup would be recognizing which CD is inserted --\nwhich might be doable faster than a seek-and-start-at-\nfirst-track operation.\n\nYou could also take the CD out while it is "playing".\n\nHmm. If the CD is still in the cache, maybe you don\'t\neven have to insert it. Or choose it from a step-through\nUI. Instead, you just wave it at an electronic eye of\nsome sort... and the player recognizes it from the \nsilkscreening. Kids would like that. "Play this," they\'d\nsay, facing the CD at the player, and the player would\nstart immediately.\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: CD player UI for toddlers'}
