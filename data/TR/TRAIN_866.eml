I get 1024x768 on the console\nand in X. The native resolution of the panel is 1280x1024. This is a step\nup on the nv driver which will give only 800x600 without being told\notherwise in xorg.conf.\n\nSo I\'m disinclined to blame the behavior of the monitor.\n\nNot the same card as my onboard nvidia but this is close to the behaviour\nI\'ve experienced:\n\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-nouveau/+bug/569505\n\n> I never had any problems with the terminus fonts, YMMV.\n\nWhich one do you use?
