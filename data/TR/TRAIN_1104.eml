I put that url, my keys and all that\ninto apt conf on the machines on the network and apt away.\n\nAs for .fi mirrors, funet is very slow. I think I use tuxfamily for\nupdates but when I see errata I usually also put that to my own one so\nrest of the machines have a shorter path to it.\nFunet hosts a whole load of mirrors and projects (it used to be (is?)\nthe main mirror for Linux. It was one of the big pub ftp sites). If\nthere was a definite apt repository, maybe they might mirror that as\nwell. I doubt RH would be very keen on using apt and forking a\ndistribution doesn\'t seem like an easy option, someone should just start\na project.\n\n-- \n"Barry also was quick to point out that the Titanium uses torque screws as\nopposed to Phillips screws. We\'re not sure why this matters even a little\nbit, but Barry sure seemed to think it was interesting.\nThat\'s why Mac geeks scare us." \t-- ZDNet Powerbook Titanium review \n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: http://apt.nixia.no/'}
