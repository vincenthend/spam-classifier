I know I do.\n\n...and I hate websites using a 200 kByte JavaScript,  sucking  500 MByte\nof memory and  consuming  100%  CPU  resources  to  implement  the  same\nfunctionality as the Adobe Flash-Pluging.\n\nYes, I know a bunch of Websites claiming there are  Flash-Free...  Using\nJavaScript for this purpose is the same crap as using Flash.\n\nThanks, Greetings and nice Day/Evening\n    Michelle Konzack\n\n-- \n##################### Debian GNU/Linux Consultant ######################\n   Development of Intranet and Embedded Systems with Debian GNU/Linux\n\nitsystems@tdnet France EURL       itsystems@tdnet UG (limited liability)\nOwner Michelle Konzack            Owner Michelle Konzack\n\nApt. 917 (homeoffice)\n50, rue de Soultz                 Kinzigstra\xdfe 17\n67100 Strasbourg/France           77694 Kehl/Germany\nTel: +33-6-61925193 mobil         Tel: +49-177-9351947 mobil\nTel: +33-9-52705884 fix\n\n<http://www.itsystems.tamay-dogan.net/>  <http://www.flexray4linux.org/>\n<http://www.debian.tamay-dogan.net/>         <http://www.can4linux.org/>\n\nJabber linux4michelle@jabber.ccc.de\nICQ    #328449886\n\nLinux-User #280138 with the Linux Counter, http://counter.li.org/\n", 'subject': 'Re: Flash is open?'}
