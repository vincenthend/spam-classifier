{'body': '(Fax) to  my direct confidential  Fax No: 234 1 7591666  \n\nDr. Kataga Bakori\nLagos, Nigeria.\n23rd July 2002\n\n\nAttention President/C.E.O\n                   \nDear Sir,\n\nREQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.\n\nFirstly I must solicit your strictest confidence in this subject. This is by virtue of its nature as \nbeing utterly confidential and top secret. A member of the Nigeria Export Promotion Council \n(N.E.P.C.) who was part of the federal government delegation to your country during a trade \nexhibition gave your particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential operation with \nyou in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all the parties and \nhope that you keep it top secret because of the nature of the business.\n\nWithin the ministry of petroleum resources where I work as a director of engineering and \nprojects, and with the co-operation of four other very top officials, we have under our \ncontrol as overdue contract payments, bills totaling Thirty One Million United States Dollars, \nwhich we want to transfer to a foreign account, with the assistance and co-operation of a \nforeign company to receive the said funds on our behalf or a reliable foreign individual \naccount to receive the funds.\n\nThe source of the fund is as follows: during the last military government here in Nigeria \nwhich lasted bout eleven months, government officials set up companies and awarded \nthemselves various contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries.  The \npresent civilian government is not aware of the atrocities committed by their predecessors \nand as a result, we have a lot of such over invoiced contract payment s pending which we \nhave identified floating at the central bank of Nigeria ready for payment.  However by virtue \nof our position as civil servants, we cannot acquire this money in our names.  I was \ntherefore delegated as a matter of urgency by my colleagues to look for an over seas \npartner into whose account we would transfer the sum of  US$31,000,000.00 (THIRTY \nONE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) hence we are writing you this letter.\n\n the present civilian government is determined to pay foreign contractors l debts owed \nso as to maintain an amiable relationship with foreign governments and non-government \nfinancial agencies.  We have decided to include our bills for approval with the co-operation \nof some officials of the federal ministry of finance (F.M.F) and the central bank of Nigeria \n(C.B.N).  We are seeking your assistance in providing us with a good company account or \nany other offshore bank account into which we can remit this money by acting our main \npartner and trustee or acting as the original contractor.  This we can do by swapping of \naccount information and changing of beneficiary and other pertinent information to apply for \npayment.  By this act, we would be using your company information to apply for payment, \nand prepare letters of claim and job description on behalf of your company.  This process \nwould be an internal arrangement with the departments concerned.\n\nI have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist \nus in this transaction, your share as compensation will be us$6.2 million (20%), us$21.7 \nmillion (70%) for us and us$3.1 (10%) for \ntaxation and miscellaneous expenses.\n\nThe business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and \nconfidentiality.  Also your area of specialization is not m hindrance to the successful \nexecution of this transaction.  I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will \nnot disappoint me. \n\nI will bring the complete picture of the transaction to your \nknowledge when I have heard from you.\n\nThanks for your co-operation,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nDr. Kataga Bakori\n\nNB: Please respond by sending a facsimile (Fax) to  my direct confidential  Fax No: 234 1 \n7591666  \n\n--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nSpamassassin-Sightings mailing list\nSpamassassin-Sightings@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-sightings\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Awiating your fax response.'}
