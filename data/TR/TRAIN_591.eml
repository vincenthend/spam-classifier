Using the install dialog I tried to make\r\nfolder ~/Desktop/crap2, but maybe messed up (that dialog is horrid)\r\nbecause it's actually created a folder ~/crap2. Which is empty, and note\r\nthis isn't ~/crap2/Desktop as in the error message above. So it's\r\nlooking in the wrong place.\r\n\r\nBy the way that install dialog is REALLY horrible. :) Especially that\r\nyou're just thrown into it. I hope you can remove the install process.\r\nYou could make it into a .dmg-distributed .app-bundle for Mac users\r\ninstead of WebStart at all, which would be nice.\r\n\r\nWebStart can be ok too, but please make it really be WebStart, ie let\r\nJava manage where the program files are stored. Either way, there's no\r\nneed to make users select a folder for user data either - you can\r\nautomatically store any user data files somewhere reasonable like\r\n~/Library/Application Support/yourapp on Mac, the equivalent Application\r\nData folder on Windows, and ~/.AppName on other platforms.\r\n\r\nEither 'normal WebStart' or '.app bundle in DMG' would give you an app\r\nthat requires no configuration or installation process, making it much\r\neasier/less scary for users to install and try out your app. Would\r\nprobably also sidestep this platform bug (?). :)\r\n\r\n--sam\r\n\r\nPS If it wasn't clear, I haven't installed the developer preview yet, so\r\nstill on 1.6.0_17... really need to do that soon.\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
