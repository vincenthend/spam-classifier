{'body': b'Back when I had regular RH7.3 there was nothing better than "apt-get upgrade". But\nnow I\'m running (null) beta and I have these questions:\n\nwhich version of "apt" can I use, the RH7.3 version or the "rawhide" version?\n\nIs there a way to use apt to update (null) with the rpms available for (null)\nthrough up2date, since I prefer apt to that?\n\nIf I can use apt, can I use it to get updates from these 3 different places:\n1. the (null) up2date Redhat upgrades\n2. the (null) files at Freshrpms.net\n3. the regular RH7.3 files from freshrpms.net\n\nAm I asking for too much simplicity in this complicated world?\n\n--\nThat\'s "angle" as in geometry.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n', 'subject': 'apt and a hybrid system'}
