No way!\n\nUnix acquired nonblocking I/O in the form of select() about 23 years\nago, and Solaris has had the particular aio_* calls we are discussing\nfor many years.  Very few applications need the aio_* calls ---\nessentially only high-performance RDBMS servers even benefit from them\nat all, and most of those have been faking it fine for a while with\nmultiple threads or processes.

By\ncontrast, the Microsoft Windows mechanisms to do similar things (such\nas completion ports) do not deliver a notification until the process\npolls them.\n\nI don\'t think signals are a better way to do things in this case\n(although I haven\'t written any RDBMSes myself), but you got the\ntechnical descriptions of the two operating systems exactly backwards.\nMost programs that use Linux real-time signals for asynchronous\nnetwork I/O, in fact, block the signal in question and poll the signal\nqueue in a very Windowsish way, using sigtimedwait() or sigwaitinfo().\n\n-- \n<kragen@pobox.com>       Kragen Sitaker     <http://www.pobox.com/~kragen/>\nEdsger Wybe Dijkstra died in August of 2002.
