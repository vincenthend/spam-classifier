{'body': 'UNCC REFUND PAYMENT FOR YOU\r\n\r\nUnited Nations Compensation Commission (UNCC):\r\nIn Affiliation With Barrack Obama Campaign to Assist Scammed Individuals In The\r\nSettlement Of Disputes Through MBNh Bank Plc, London , United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttention: Sir/Madam\r\n\r\nHow are you doing today? Hope all is well with you and your family? You may\r\nnot understand why this mail came to you but kindly read the following procedures\r\nfor your claim. The United Nation Compensation Commission (UNCC) was created in\r\n1991 as a subsidiary organ of the UN Security Council. Its mandate is to process\r\nclaims and pay compensation for losses and damages suffered as a direct result of\r\nInternet Fraud.\r\n\r\nThe UNCC in conjunction with the Obama Campaign on the 12th of October\r\n2008 organized a confederation meeting which ended 2 weeks later, with the\r\nSecretary General to the UNITED NATIONS. This meeting was first held on the 8th of\r\nApril 2003 by the then secretary to the UN. You can view this page for your perusal\r\n(http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/ik344.doc.htm).\r\n\r\nThis email is directed to all individuals that have been scammed in all parts of\r\nthe world. In reference to the just concluded meeting, the UNCC in affiliation\r\nwith Barrack Obama Campaign have agreed to compensate them with categorical\r\npayment sum of $500,000 each. In its decision 17" of 24th March 2006, the\r\nGoverning Council established basic principles for the distribution of\r\ncompensation payments to successful claimants. This decision was made two months\r\nbefore the resolution of the first installment of claims before the Commission.\r\nAs stated in the Secretary-General\x92s report of 2nd May 2006, it was anticipated\r\nthat the value of approved awards would far exceed the resources available in the\r\nCompensation Fund at any given time. The Governing Council therefore devised a\r\nmechanism for the allocation of available funds to successful claimants that gave\r\npriority to the three urgent categories of claims and which, within each\r\ncategory, would give equal treatment to similarly situated claims. Only when each\r\nsuccessful claimant in categories "A", "B" and "C" had been paid an initial\r\namount up to US$2,500 would payments commence for claims in other categories.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the first phase of payment involved an initial payment of US$2,500\r\nto each successful individual claimant in categories "A" and "C". However, for\r\nhumanitarian reasons, all category "B" claims will be paid in full of a total\r\nUSD$500,000. A total of US$3,252,337,997.09 was made available to 1,498,119\r\nsuccessful individual claimants in categories "A", "B" and "C" under the first\r\nphase of payments. Claimants includes every foreign contractor that may have not\r\nreceived their contract sum, and people that have had an unfinished transaction or\r\ninternational businesses that failed due to Government problems etc.We found\r\nyour name in our list and that is why you are receiving this email notification.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are advised hereby to contact Mr. Jim Ovia of Zenith Bank Plc, as he is our\r\nrepresentative in Nigeria who will be releasing your refund payment to you.\r\nContact him immediately for your approved funds(USD$500,000).
