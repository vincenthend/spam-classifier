Without KPackage, KDE isn\'t\r\nmuch use.\r\n\r\n>> In KDE3, one could not only easily manage the apt sources from inside\r\n>> the app, but also RPM repositories.

Many packages simply do not have Debian sources,\r\nand I have used KPackage to successfully install many alien packages. \r\nIn some cases, there may be a reasonable .deb subsitute, but many\r\npackages, most notably hardware drives, simply have no substitute.  Two\r\nof my RAID controllers, for example, only have RPM distros.  Surely you\r\nare not suggesting a PC - Debian or otherwise - can do without its hard\r\ndrives?  They installed fine under KDE3.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-kde-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe". Trouble?
