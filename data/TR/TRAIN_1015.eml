Many packages simply do not have Debian sources,\nand I have used KPackage to successfully install many alien packages. \nIn some cases, there may be a reasonable .deb subsitute, but many\npackages, most notably hardware drives, simply have no substitute.  Two\nof my RAID controllers, for example, only have RPM distros.  Surely you\nare not suggesting a PC - Debian or otherwise - can do without its hard\ndrives?  They installed fine under KDE3.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-kde-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe". Trouble?
