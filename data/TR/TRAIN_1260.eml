There are two cases I\nsee crop up: one, aptitude suggests removing packages without an\nobvious replacement.  Two, aptitude marks things as broken that have\nbeen working just fine.  In either case, I start slamming the "=" key\nuntil packages will no longer be removed, and nothing is marked\nbroken.  This works 99.99% of the time.  At some later period when I\nsuspect the storm has passed, I test the waters by unholding the\npackages and gauging aptitude\'s reaction.\n\nI also use "hold" when apt-listbugs + some investigation leads me to\nbelieve I\'m better off with the current version.  (There\'s some reason\nI don\'t use forbid-version, but I don\'t recall.  Maybe it wasn\'t\npersisting between sessions?  But that would have been years ago.)\n\nAll of which is to say, just because I\'ve marked a package on hold\ndoesn\'t mean that I want it on my system forever.  But if that\'s the\nonly way to deal with the problem, then I can certainly manage.  My\nsystem is ancient, and there are already plenty of package on it whose\npresence I can\'t easily explained.  What\'s the harm in a few more?\n\nIf this is a misuse of "hold" and there\'s a better way, though, I\'m\nall ears.  Rereading, it seems like "forbid-version" would be the\nright call for most of what I\'m doing, assuming it does persist\nbetween aptitude sessions.\n\n-- \nmonique\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
