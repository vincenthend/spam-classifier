There are two cases I\r\nsee crop up: one, aptitude suggests removing packages without an\r\nobvious replacement.  Two, aptitude marks things as broken that have\r\nbeen working just fine.  In either case, I start slamming the "=" key\r\nuntil packages will no longer be removed, and nothing is marked\r\nbroken.  This works 99.99% of the time.  At some later period when I\r\nsuspect the storm has passed, I test the waters by unholding the\r\npackages and gauging aptitude\'s reaction.\r\n\r\nI also use "hold" when apt-listbugs + some investigation leads me to\r\nbelieve I\'m better off with the current version.  (There\'s some reason\r\nI don\'t use forbid-version, but I don\'t recall.  Maybe it wasn\'t\r\npersisting between sessions?  But that would have been years ago.)\r\n\r\nAll of which is to say, just because I\'ve marked a package on hold\r\ndoesn\'t mean that I want it on my system forever.  But if that\'s the\r\nonly way to deal with the problem, then I can certainly manage.  My\r\nsystem is ancient, and there are already plenty of package on it whose\r\npresence I can\'t easily explained.  What\'s the harm in a few more?\r\n\r\nIf this is a misuse of "hold" and there\'s a better way, though, I\'m\r\nall ears.  Rereading, it seems like "forbid-version" would be the\r\nright call for most of what I\'m doing, assuming it does persist\r\nbetween aptitude sessions.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nmonique\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
