Kind of smart polling.\n\nIf you don't want to poll you can use an ImageAvailableCallback and  \nand an input queue but I don't see much benefit from that. The  \noverhead of the display link is small and if you suspect that your  \nmovie has a higher frame rate than the display refresh time you can  \nalways call QTVisualContextIsNewImageAvailable multiple times until it  \nreturns false. Either you can keep up with the input or else you are  \ngoing to drop frames. The ImageAvailableCallback won't  help you there.\n\nJan E.\n\n _______________________________________________\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
