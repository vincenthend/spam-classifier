This result changes when I change in alsamixer L R Capture\r\n> parameter (Capture [dB gain=6.00, 6.00] - lots of noise and quite sound,\r\n> Capture [dB gain=30.00, 30.00] - rhythmical crack). Maybe this is a problem\r\n> of bad configuration. Who can help?\r\n> I have not only one parameter but two parameters L R Capture and now I was\r\n> talking about the first of them.
