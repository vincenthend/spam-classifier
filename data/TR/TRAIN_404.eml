{'body': 'There is a known race condition between native background repainting and Java drawing in the resize/scrolling case for Java applets embedded in the browser process. The reason you don\'t see this behavior when using the out-of-process plugin is because the applet painting is happening in a seperate process, and the browser is "pulling the pixels" from the Java process when the browser thinks it\'s a good time to repaint.\n\nI\'m not clear why unchecking the "64-bit" checkbox in Java Preferences should enable or disable the out-of-process vs. in-process applet setting. If your MacBook is actually 32-bit only, you should never even see the 64-bit JVMs.\n\nOn May 21, 2010, at 4:42 AM, Rob Dickens wrote:\n\n> Have just tested my applet on a 64-bit Mac, and it seems,\n> \n> * you have to select the \'In their own process\' preference, in order\n> to stop the flicker-on-resize\n> \n> * unticking the 64-bit Java checkbox greys out the radio buttons that\n> let you make the above change.\n> \n> Ergo, the non-flickering applet container is only available on 64-bit Macs.\n> \n> If anyone from Apple could clarify the situation, I\'d be much obliged.\n> \n> On Wed, May 19, 2010 at 10:41 AM, Chung-Kai Chen <ckchen@realtek.com> wrote:\n> \n>> It\'s really frustrating to see something on Mac so bad compared to Windows.\n>> I use this page (http://www.javafx.com/samples/TableInsights/index.html) to test\n>> the newly arrived JVM and it still flickers like a hell when scrolling the page.\n>> The same applet run on Windows hosted in VirtualBox on my Mac shows almost\n>> no flickering.\n>> \n>> \n>> 2010/5/19 Rob Dickens <robcdickens@csmining.org>:\n>> \n>>> Dear Mac-Java Devs,\n>>> \n>>> Have just installed the new version of Java, hoping that my applets[1]\n>>> (in Safari) would stop flickering when I resized the browser\n>>> window--something which the release notes suggest[2] might be the\n>>> case--, but I find that they do still flicker.\n>>> \n>>> One thing I note is that the Java Preferences app won\'t let me change\n>>> the way applets are run (from \'Within the browser process\' to \'In\n>>> their own process\'), since the radio buttons are greyed out.\n>>> \n>>> I\'m on a 32-bit MacBook, btw.\n>>> \n>>> Please could somebody help.\n>>> \n>>> Best regards,\n>>> \n>>> Rob\n>>> \n>>> 1 http://lafros.com/gui\n>>> 2 Plugin2 Graphics Rendering\n>>> <http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/releasenotes/CrossPlatform/JavaSnowLeopardUpdate2LeopardUpdate7RN/NewandNoteworthy/NewandNoteworthy.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009967-CH4-SW1>\n\nRegards,\nMike Swingler\nJava Runtime Engineer\nApple Inc.\n\n _______________________________________________\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
