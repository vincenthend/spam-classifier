{'body': 'URL: http://boingboing.net/#85534626\nDate: Not supplied\n\nAfter discovering an open wireless net available from his sofa, Steven \n"Hackers" Levy interviewed lawmen, academics and WiFi activists about the \nlegality and ethics of using open wireless access points. \n\n    I downloaded my mail and checked media news on the Web. When I confessed \n    this to FBI agent Bill Shore, he spared the handcuffs. "The FBI wouldn\'t \n    waste resources on that," he sniffed. Now I know that if it did, it would \n    be hard to argue that I broke a law. What\'s more, I certainly didn\'t feel \n    illegal. Becauseand this is the point of all that war-driving and \n    -chalking and node-stumblingwhen you get used to wireless, the experience \n    feels more and more like a God-given right. One day we may breathe \n    bandwidth like oxygenand arguing its illegality will be unthinkable.  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Steven[3]!_)\n\n[1] http://www.msnbc.com/news/816606.asp\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/f5ZpuJU5975K\n[3] http://www.echonyc.com/~steven/\n\n\n', 'subject': "Steven Levy's wireless neighbors"}
