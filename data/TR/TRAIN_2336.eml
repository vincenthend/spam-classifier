My main issue with the akonadi/mysql dependencies is thus \nsolved.\n\n(Yes, it is not very cool to have mysql running for akonadi and virtuoso for \nnepomuk/strigi and probably quite a few copies of libsqlite and libdb for \nother subsystems.  But I guess we\'ll just have to live with that unless \nwe\'re prepared to do the work ourselves... )\n\ncheers\n-- vbi\n\n-- \nForgive him, for he believes that the customs of his tribe are the laws\nof nature!\n\t\t-- G.
