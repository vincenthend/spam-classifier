Sure, there are other\nmeans outside of the circumstance of the occurence. BUt until we're\nwilling to eliminate the ability to speak in public -only- for the\nside that doesn't agree with the political force, and make that part\nof the 1st amendment, the parties -are- screaming and shouting over\npolitical figures because they cannot be heard (to those figures) in\nany other way.\n\nMF> I don't think free speech is a license to speak directly at and be in the\nMF> physical presence of any particular individual of your choosing - especially\nMF> when that individual is busy doing something else and isn't interested.\n\nSure.  And that goes back to my second argument -- Cohen.   THey can\nwalk away.   NObody compells them to stand there, I'll agree fully.\nBut we still have a Constitutional right to speak out against\npolicies, actions and grievances.\n\nAgain.  If you want it another way, lets change the Constitution.\n\n\n\n-- \nBest regards,\n bitbitch                            mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net\n\n\n", 'subject': 'Re[4]: A moment of silence for the First Amendment (fwd)'}
