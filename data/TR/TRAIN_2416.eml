{'body': 'In recent Java versions, there is a regression that prevents Java Web =\r\nStart applications from launching if there is no internet connection, =\r\neven if they have <offline-allowed/> attribute.  Launching without an =\r\ninternet connection causes the application to "hang".  This is a serious =\r\nproblem for us, since many of our users move between having an internet =\r\nconnection and not having an internet connection - we have lots of =\r\nunhappy customers.\r\n\r\nI believe that at least part of the problem is this Oracle bug: =\r\n<http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=3D6911785> which =\r\nclaims will be fixed in 1.6.0_20.  (There also seem to be other bugs =\r\nbecause launching without an internet connection still takes way too =\r\nlong even with the developer preview of 1.6.0_20 on Windows7 - but at =\r\nleast it does launch.)\r\n\r\nHas anyone figured out a workaround for this problem?  Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nthanks, Nick=\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
