{'body': 'In recent Java versions, there is a regression that prevents Java Web Start applications from launching if there is no internet connection, even if they have <offline-allowed/> attribute.  Launching without an internet connection causes the application to "hang".  This is a serious problem for us, since many of our users move between having an internet connection and not having an internet connection - we have lots of unhappy customers.\n\nI believe that at least part of the problem is this Oracle bug: <http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6911785> which claims will be fixed in 1.6.0_20.  (There also seem to be other bugs because launching without an internet connection still takes way too long even with the developer preview of 1.6.0_20 on Windows7 - but at least it does launch.)\n\nHas anyone figured out a workaround for this problem?  Any suggestions?\n\nthanks, Nick _______________________________________________\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
