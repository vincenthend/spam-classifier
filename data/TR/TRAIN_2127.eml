KDE 4 is different.  I don\'t like it.  If I have to, in effect, change \nDE, and go through the learning curve again, there is no reason why it would \nhave to be to KDE 4.  When the time comes that I cannot sensibly go on using \nKDE 3, I shall chose where I go next on the basis of what the options are \nlooking like at the time.  I can see little liklihood that that choice will \nbe KDE 4.  I may even switch to a window manager without a DE, and chose \nother ways of working, if that is the only way that I can avoid the glitz \nthat is now all the rage.\n\nHow things look is very important to me.  I have problems with my eyes, and \nhow a thing looks can influence whether I can work on a thing for one minute, \nten minutes or an hour.\n\nI have no problem with other people liking and wanting to use KDE 4.  I have a \nproblem with their, in some cases, not allowing me the freedom _not_ to use \nit.  And I personally shall mourn the passing of KDE 3.\n\nLisi\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe". Trouble?
