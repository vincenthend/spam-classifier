{'body': 'I have been experimenting with the mbr package.  (mbr is a dependency for\nthe lilo package; so if you have lilo installed you have mbr package installed\ntoo.)  I usually install lilo to the master boot record (boot=/dev/hda\nspecified in /etc/lilo.conf).  But in certain situations it is advantageous to\ninstall lilo to the boot sector of a primary partition (boot=/dev/hda1) and\ninstall a DOS-like master boot record program in the master boot record,\nmaking the partition containing the lilo boot loader the active partition.\n\nFor example, on some of our Dell servers one can bring up a "boot menu" via\nthe BIOS setup program by pressing F12 during the POST process.  (This is during\nPOST and before the actual boot process.)  Upon completion of POST, the "BIOS\nboot menu" (not to be confused with the boot menu of any boot loader) will\nbe displayed.  One of the choices in this BIOS boot menu is "Boot to Utility\nPartition", or something like that.  This boots a maintenance partition\ncontaining some hardware testing programs supplied by Dell.  This works fine\nif the master boot record is a standard DOS/Windows-style master boot record,\nbut does not work with Linux-style boot loaders, such as grub or lilo.\nOf course, I can always add the maintenance partition to the lilo boot\nmenu, but our non-Linux-proficient technicians aren\'t used to this.  I\nwant a Linux box to look just like a Windows box as viewed by a service\ntechnician.\n\nI could use DOS or Windows to install its master boot record program\nwith "fdisk /mbr" or fixmbr, or whatever, depending on the release of\nDOS or Windows, and set the Linux partition active, and that works.  But\nMicrosoft may claim that this means that our box requires a license\nfor DOS or Windows.  I\'d hate to burn a Windows license just to get its\nmaster boot record installed, when that\'s all I\'m using.  It would seem that\nthe mbr package in Debian GNU/Linux is just the ticket for this sort of\nproblem.  I have run the "install-mbr" program, and it works just as\nexpected.  There is just one little nit left that I would like to take\ncare of.  lilo advertises itself by printing out "LILO" on the screen\nprior to booting the Linux kernel.  That\'s fine.  I want to see that.\nmbr also advertises itself by printing out "MBR" on the screen when it\nboots.  So what I see at boot time is something like this:\n\n   MBR\n\n   LILO 22.8 Loading Linux\n   BIOS data check successful\n\nand then the Linux kernel boot messages.  That\'s tolerable, but I\'d\nlike that "MBR" advertisement to be eliminated.  I read the man page\nfor install-mbr, and I can see how to eliminate the boot prompt,\nwhich I have done, but I couldn\'t find a way to suppress the MBR\nadvertisement.  The DOS/Windows mbr program is totally silent, a trick\nthat I would like to teach this program.  Does anyone know of a way\nto accomplish this?  Or is this just something I have to live with?\n\n-- \n  .\'\'`.
