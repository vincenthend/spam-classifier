Now with my laptop\nrunning Linux Mint 8 the version of Wicd in the archive (1.6.1-3ubuntu)\nhas a real heartache going from one of my WPA networks to the other WPA\nnetwork by getting into a state where it says "no wireless networks\nfound" and only a reboot seems to clear it (I was too lazy/rushed to\ntry various things like reloading the kernel driver, etc.)  I\'ve now\ngiven Network Manager a try again and It Just Works (TM) and lets me\nroam from one network to the other through suspend seemlessly.\n\nTong, if your laptop has an Atheros based card (AR5212 chipset) it will\nuse the ath5k driver which works very very well.  I\'ve been using an\nAtheros based card and the laptops I\'ve had have been Atheros based for\nseveral years.  It\'s probably the best supported chipset out there. \nOnce you enjoy the freedom of movement that wireless offers, you\'ll\nwonder why you didn\'t try it sooner.\n\nFeel free trying to kill time setting up the low level tools manually. \nI suggest that if you\'re running one of the desktop environments\n(GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.) then you\'ll be better served just using\nNetwork Manager or Wicd as both are easy to use and make dealing with\nmultiple wireless networks very easy.\n\n- Nate >>\n\n-- \n\n"The optimist proclaims that we live in the best of all\npossible worlds.
