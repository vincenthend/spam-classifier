Check\r\n"/etc/initramfs-tools/". There is a "resume" file (in that dir or in a\r\nsubdir) that will have your swap partition\'s UUID.\r\n\r\nRe 2. What do you mean by "After changing the UUID of the new\r\npartition"? After "dd...", did your run "tune2fs -U ..." on your root\r\npartition (or the equivalent for xfs, ...; I am assuming that you have\r\njust one partition)? If you didn\'t, your root partition still has the\r\nsame UUID and update-grub is picking it up correctly (in which case, I\r\nhave no idea idea how you are booting up!).\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
