It's entirely possible that rpm can be \nconfigured to require good signatures, but I've not read that part of \nthe fine manual just yet.\n\nCheers,\nWaider.\n-- \nwaider@waider.ie / Yes, it /is/ very personal of me\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n", 'subject': 'Re: [ILUG] packaging risks and the reputation of linux distributions'}
