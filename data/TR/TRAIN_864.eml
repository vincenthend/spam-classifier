I think the current figure for the US is a little over 2, but\nnot quite the ~2.1 of replacement rate. Combined with the very fertile\nnon-native population, the article implied the US was going to have a\nsignificant increase in population over earlier predictions. As well, the\npopulation would overall be more youthful, with associated implications for\nbeing able to fund social programs, military spending, consumer spending,\netc.\n\nEurope did not show the same increase in fertility.\n\nSome actual data for the US are here:\n\nhttp://www.census.gov/population/pop-profile/2000/chap04.pdf\nPart of:\nhttp://www.census.gov/population/www/pop-profile/profile2000.html\n\n- Jim\n\n\n", 'subject': 'RE: Re[2]: Selling Wedded Bliss (was Re: Ouch...)'}
