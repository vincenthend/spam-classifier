My use of Compiz was \njust a part of exploration of the Gnome DE. I don\'t even use Gnome now.\n\n > ... because I don\'t need glitzy special effects.\n\nNeither do I. That\'s why I use Xfce.\n\n > Are there any non-glitzy benefits to compositors?\n\nI occasionally turn on Xfce\'s compositing for specific tasks in which it \nactually makes my work easier. But most if the time, it\'s off.\n\n > Which driver version do you use?\n\nnv - Debian Squeeze\n\nGave up finally in December last year trying to get the blobs to work \nreliably. They\'re simply not worth the effort for someone with my \nparticular needs.\n\nI\'m reasonably happy with the systems with the nvidia workstation cards. \nBut the cheaper systems with Intel and ATI graphics are faster and \nhandle any special effects I might want (like occasional use of desktop \ncompositing) better, and I\'m happier with them. Nvidia is simply not on \nmy radar for any future systems because I consider their approach to \nLinux to be inimical to FOSS.\n\nPS: My apologies. Recent update to my mail client coupled with lack of \nsleep. I accidentally sent Ron a direct e-mail reply. Mea culpa.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe". Trouble?
