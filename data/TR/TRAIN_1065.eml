For me, my Back-UPS XS 1000 was one of my\r\n> best computer-related purchases.\r\n\r\nI\'ve got an old APC RM1400NET in the bottom of my home rack backing just one\r\nserver at the moment, a rarely used CRT, and my comms gear.  I get about an\r\nhour out of it during a total outage.  I bought it used from a local "off\r\nlease equipment" reseller/liquidator.  Gave just over $100 USD for it.  The\r\nbattery pack lasted 6 months.  Bought a replacement pack from batteries.com\r\nfor a little over $100 with shipping.  I\'ve got over 4 years on the current\r\nbattery pack.  Average lifespan on the 1400 pack is 5-7 years depending on\r\nthe number and duration of inverter cycles.  As with you, this is one of the\r\nsmartest hardware purchases I ever made.  The electronics and electrical\r\nparts in UPSes very rarely fail, so as long as you replace batteries every 5\r\nyears or so you\'d got reliable power backup, and cheap--$20 per year\r\nbasically for batteries.  This level of power (and piece of mind) protection\r\ncosts less per year than one trip to the movie theater to see Avatar.\r\n\r\nI\'ve got an equally old MinuteMan 650 floor model backing my home\r\nworkstation.  Again I purchased this one used from a liquidator (different\r\none in this case) for around $40 back in 1998.  I\'ve replaced the battery\r\nonce after 6 years and am about ready to replace it again.  The battery for\r\nthis one runs around $40.\r\n\r\nToday you can buy a 700kva class consumer UPS for $100.  If the battery\r\nlasts you 5 years, you\'ve paid $20/year for power/surge and data protection.\r\n Not to mention convenience.\r\n\r\nI can\'t imagine ever going without a UPS, whether server or workstation.\r\nLaptops are great because, for all practical purposes, you get a free UPS\r\nbuilt in.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nStan\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
