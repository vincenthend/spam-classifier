I hope that I am wrong.\n\nWell, for watching movies in your PC you can always use the media player \nabilities to re-scale the video into 4:3 aspect ratio :-)\n\nBut if your vga card cannot provide higher resolutions to the monitor, \nthen you are stuck: LCDs can only work well at their native resolution. \nSo your first step should be to find the specs of your VGA card and check \nwhat is the maximum resolution it can provide.\n\nYour display will be happy at 1680x1050@60Hz.\n\nGreetings,\n\n-- \nCamalen\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
