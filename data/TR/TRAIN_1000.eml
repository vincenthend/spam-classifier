I read all the messages in the same manner.\r\n\r\n"The specs are open"... o.k., now so it seems. Since 2008, just 2 years \r\nago, which is good, but Adobe, since the adquisition of Macromedia on \r\n2005, was holding all the rights on Flash format.\r\n\r\n"(not having a good FLOSS Flash player) Not the fault of Adobe...". Of \r\ncourse not! The fault of Adobe, and this is my personal POW, is \r\ndeveloping a very bad quality flash player, for all the users (windows, \r\nlinux, Solaris). \r\n\r\nHeck, how in the hell can a company provide such players if they are the \r\ndevelopers of the product the players are handling (.swf)? I cannot \r\nunderstand that, and "that" precisely makes me doubt about the quality of \r\nthe format they are trying to populate and rise.\r\n\r\nThat said, even they (they=Adobe)now "open the specs" for Flash I will \r\navoid either using it or promoting as much as I can.\r\n\r\n<flashback mode on>\r\n\r\nIn the times I worked as webmaster and web designer (now sysadmin), \r\npeople (clients, partners and my company) "urged" me to adopt flash \r\ntechnology, just because "looked nice" and, "(sic) hey, anyone has the \r\nFlash Player installed so it was also kinda cross-platform". \r\n\r\nYes, Flash Player was (is) available for many systems but the fact is \r\nthat that did not change my perception about the suitability of using it.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing you couldn\'t do with standard html technologies \r\n(javascript, css, dom...) that Flash can, so why bother about spending \r\ntime and money in acquiring a license for Adobe products that were (in \r\nthose times) the only powerful ones that allowed the development of "rich \r\nsites" ("rich site" \xe2\x86\x92 Adobe "dixit")?\r\n\r\nWhy bother if there was only a unique Flash player out there and was \r\npretty bad quality? Why forcing my users to have to use such player if \r\nthere were alternatives in a very good shape that were open and \r\ncompatible?\r\n\r\nMy perception is that web developers wrongly refugiated into flash to \r\nescape from the incompatibilities of the web browers, any of them \r\napplying different renderings of the elements of the page layout and not \r\nfollowing the W3C standards. Yes, Firefox and Opera had also their own \r\nglicthes and of course, Internet Explorer.\r\n\r\nSo web developers, instead trying to compatibilize "the \r\nincompatibilities" of the browsers by making a more fine-grained code, \r\nthey took the "easy path" and just fall into the arms of Flash format: \r\nformat was bad but hey, at least it renedered the site in the same manner \r\nin all the browsers >:-)\r\n\r\nAnd then it came html5, promoting open standard ways to handle video and \r\naudio... ooops, Adobe must thought their Flash format will be forgotten \r\nand lost in the Helm\'s Deep if html5 will succeed, so the decided to open \r\nFlash to be more user-friendly and calm down the accusations about \r\nmonopolistic tactics, being their flash player installed in more than 95% \r\nof the computers >:-)\r\n\r\nAdn here we are now, with Adobe developing, promoting and enforcing DRM \r\ntechnologies in their products and, OTOH providing an "open spec" for \r\nflash... quite contradictory :-)\r\n\r\nThat is my personal opinion, of course.\r\n\r\n<flashback mode off/>\r\n \r\n>> And the same situation goes for Adobe Reader for Linux.

I\'m working for a engineering company, and I\'m "forced" (is \r\nmarket demand, we need a 110% compatibilty with our partners and they use \r\nAutoCAD...) to use such products.\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\n\r\n-- \r\nCamale\xc3\xb3n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
