The technique works for input \nvalues between 0 and 1 and supports large exponents. The presented shader does \nnot require any texture look-up and is scalable, making it possible to spend \nmore instructions in order to decrease the error or to reach greater exponents.\n\n\n", 'subject': 'A Non-Integer Power Function on the Pixel Shader'}
