Interestingly, if I grab the applet window, I get the clipped applet display stretched to fit the size of the entire applet window.  If I grab the firefox window, I just get the firefox window display.  I guess this makes sense since the applet runs in a separate process, though I don\'t understand why the applet display is getting messed up.

In \nparticlar, the rendering errors I\'ve seen are gone.  However, I have \nnoticed one new problem which I don\'t think was present in the previous \nversion of the plugin.  I can\'t (mouse) drag inside an applet in Firefox. \nDragging works in Safari.  If I open\n\nhttp://pivot.apache.org/demos/decorators.html\n\nI can\'t move the "window" by dragging the title bar.  Also, if I open\n\nhttp://pivot.apache.org/demos/itunes-search.html\n\nand search for "beethoven" I cannot drag the scrollbar.  Do you have the \nsame problem?\n\nCheers,\n\nMichael\n _______________________________________________\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
