Interestingly, if I grab the applet window, I get the clipped applet display stretched to fit the size of the entire applet window.  If I grab the firefox window, I just get the firefox window display.  I guess this makes sense since the applet runs in a separate process, though I don\'t understand why the applet display is getting messed up.

In \r\nparticlar, the rendering errors I\'ve seen are gone.  However, I have \r\nnoticed one new problem which I don\'t think was present in the previous \r\nversion of the plugin.  I can\'t (mouse) drag inside an applet in Firefox. \r\nDragging works in Safari.  If I open\r\n\r\nhttp://pivot.apache.org/demos/decorators.html\r\n\r\nI can\'t move the "window" by dragging the title bar.  Also, if I open\r\n\r\nhttp://pivot.apache.org/demos/itunes-search.html\r\n\r\nand search for "beethoven" I cannot drag the scrollbar.  Do you have the \r\nsame problem?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nMichael\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
