One reason for the lack of excitement over the project in the free \r\nsoftware world is that it omits "huge amounts" of information needed for \r\na complete implementation of Flash. In particular, Savoye points out that \r\nthe announcement contains no mention of the Real Time Messaging Protocol\r\n(RTMP) that is required for the Flash media server. Nor does it mention \r\nthe Sorenson Spark Codec that is used for video encoding in Flash 6 and \r\n7, and remains the choice of some users still for Flash video because \r\nother formats convert easily to it. Both may be encumbered by patents \r\nbut, without them, the information that Adobe has released is of limited \r\nuse."\r\n\r\n> I always thought that the reason for all the trouble with Flash on Linux\r\n> is that Flash was a closed standard.

There are also some concerns about software \r\npatents (for using -and distributing- MP3 codecs or FLV).\r\n\r\nAnyway, I agree with your "hidden demand" ;-)\r\n\r\nLook at PDF. PDF became a ISO/IEC standard but we (at linux) still lack \r\nfor a PDF editor that can compete with Acrobat Professional.\r\n \r\nGreetings,\r\n\r\n-- \r\nCamale\xc3\xb3n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
