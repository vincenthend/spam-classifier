Of course, as long as you are using only characters\nthat are in ASCII, UTF-8 is compatible... There is also GB 18030, China\'s\nUnicode encoding, but again, it is ASCII compatible.\n\nThe Win32, .NET and Java platforms all use UTF-16/USC-2 (it\'s complicated)\nnatively, which is not ASCII and is not ASCII compatible.\n\nJoel\'s Unicode article is from 2003, but still very useful:\nhttp://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html\n\nSome good essays from Tim Bray:\nhttp://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/06/Unicode\nhttp://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/13/Strings\nhttp://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/26/UTF\nhttp://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/30/JavaStrings\n\n\nCheers,\nKelly Clowers\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
