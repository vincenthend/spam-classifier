Of course, as long as you are using only characters\r\nthat are in ASCII, UTF-8 is compatible... There is also GB 18030, China\'s\r\nUnicode encoding, but again, it is ASCII compatible.\r\n\r\nThe Win32, .NET and Java platforms all use UTF-16/USC-2 (it\'s complicated)\r\nnatively, which is not ASCII and is not ASCII compatible.\r\n\r\nJoel\'s Unicode article is from 2003, but still very useful:\r\nhttp://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html\r\n\r\nSome good essays from Tim Bray:\r\nhttp://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/06/Unicode\r\nhttp://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/13/Strings\r\nhttp://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/26/UTF\r\nhttp://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/30/JavaStrings\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nKelly Clowers\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
