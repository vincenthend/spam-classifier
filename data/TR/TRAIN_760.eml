{'body': '\n        OK, I\'m stumped.  I was having some problems which were likely related\nto the old kernel in Debian "Lenny", so I upgraded to "Squeeze" in\norder to alleviate the issue, which it apparently has.  Now, however, I\nneed to fsck the main array on the box, which is formatted as XFS.  The\nxfs-repair utility is not on the upgraded system.  (I was forced to do\na fresh install of the boot drive.)  How can I obtain the XFS file\nutilities - particularly xfs-repair - under "Squeeze"?\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
