Maybe the\r\ndevelopment time is actually a bonus, if you\'re interested in that\r\nsort of tinkering already.\r\n\r\nAll of that being said - this entire thread is really a question of\r\nsecurity, and security is a process and an approach, not an end result.\r\nThere is no such thing as a 100% secure system that is also useful, in\r\nthe same way that there is no such thing as a 100% secure PDF that is\r\nalso useful.  So the real goal is to make the document "secure enough"\r\nfor one\'s purposes, while also making the document "usable enough" for\r\nthose purposes.  I think there have been a lot of good ideas on this\r\nthread for managing that trade-off.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nmonique\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
