Maybe the\ndevelopment time is actually a bonus, if you\'re interested in that\nsort of tinkering already.\n\nAll of that being said - this entire thread is really a question of\nsecurity, and security is a process and an approach, not an end result.\nThere is no such thing as a 100% secure system that is also useful, in\nthe same way that there is no such thing as a 100% secure PDF that is\nalso useful.  So the real goal is to make the document "secure enough"\nfor one\'s purposes, while also making the document "usable enough" for\nthose purposes.  I think there have been a lot of good ideas on this\nthread for managing that trade-off.\n\n-- \nmonique\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
