This will help because some packages are named\ndifferently between distributions (eg. SDL <-> libSDL), and the\ndependencies are automatically handled by RPM by depending on shared\nlibrary names.\n\nThis doesn't apply to BuildRequires: though.\n\nUse macros for directory names where available, eg %{_libdir},\n%{_bindir}, %{_datadir} etc.\n\nI'd like to suggest using as many RPM macros for command names as\npossible too, but unfortunately I don't know of a definitive reference\nabout them...\n\nI have a small RedHat 7.3 RPM/apt repository at\n<http://cachalot.ods.org/>, and I've received reports from people\nrunning Mandrake 8.x and SuSE that the RPMs work with them out of the\nbox.\n\n-- \n\\/ille Skytt\xe4\nville.skytta at iki.fi\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n", 'subject': 'Re: Portable RPMs'}
