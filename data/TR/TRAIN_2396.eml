It would be news to\nme if these adaptors worked the other way round, too.\n\nBut if it actually works, you should be able to talk to the device using\nthe regular /dev/ttyS0.\n\nJ.\n-- \nWatching television is more hip than actually speaking to anyone.\n[Agree]   [Disagree]\n                 <http://www.slowlydownward.com/NODATA/data_enter2.html>\n', 'subject': 'Re: USB device attached via RS232 adaptor'}
