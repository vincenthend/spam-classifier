(If you don't \nuse RDF or Python you can probably safely skip this entry.)  \n\nNew in this version: RDF library abstraction (because rdflib's organization \ncurrently sucks), write values in addition to reading, and unit tests, all with \nthat old TRAMP flavor you've come to know and love.  \n\n_But wait,_ it also comes with an entire page of explanation/advertisement[1] \nif you're not already convinced.\n\n\n\n    RDF/XML got you down? Tired of having to go through contortions to deal \n    with data? Want to write Python and be standards-compatible at the same \n    time? Need a module to implement the psuedo-code you had on your slides? *\n    TRAMP may or may not be the answer to these problems!*\n\n\n\nEnjoy, and get a free bonus prize if you can tell me[2] why it's called TRAMP.\n\n\n\n[1] http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/tramp\n[2] mailto:me@aaronsw.com\n\n\n", 'subject': 'TRAMP Update'}
