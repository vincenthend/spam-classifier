It is based on the Tomcat or some such product launcher  \ncode and uses a ant task approach but I think in the end just amounts  \nto Runtime exec'd java. Assuming you can decide at Runtime what  \nparameters you want to use.\n\nMike Hall        hallmike at att dot net\nhttp://www195.pair.com/mik3hall\nhttp://www195.pair.com/mik3hall/home.html\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/macnative\n\n\n\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG/MacGPG2 v2.0.14 (Darwin)\n\niJwEAQECAAYFAkv316oACgkQUvk/ZSaThTIUYgQA1mPCmS7+PV50rbyd42CZOsNA\nlFzhnQ9/WVN2bZ4jGtslb/tRWL37M9Rur9+pFYT8ssFjL+V0t4TPO3JJ5Tu0GEAT\nCZUeMVVi1i3qOWYjEAd9E+k7Xv2jl7F5qPiBqNWKLSqS2IcHoAzLtU9oBaH8GmBR\nuL2U2OHgWq3FSj2JrDg=\n=tMkY\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n _______________________________________________\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
