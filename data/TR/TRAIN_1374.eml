{'body': 'From nobody Fri Sep  7 01:04:39 2018\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1\n\nHello,\r\n\r\nI\'ve been using linux (debian) for about a year now, and although I\'m no\r\nlonger scared of the command line I would like to do a little\r\nreading/studying of linux to get a better understanding of some of the more\r\nadvanced topics, or to see if I have learned a lot of the things that might\r\nbe taught in a university-linux/UNIX course. I\'m sure that there is a lot of\r\nstuff that I\'ve missed by just going at it with trial and error. Perhaps\r\nthere are some online courses posted to youtube, or a few books that someone\r\nmight like to recommend? I would be interested to know what types of things\r\none must learn to get "linux-certification" (I presume there is such a\r\nthing).\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJames\r\n', 'subject': 'Resources for learning Linux'}
