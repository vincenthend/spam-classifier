Permissions come\nfrom the mounted FS, not the mount point, so make sure you set these\npermissions while it\'s mounted.\n\n  Because of the world-writability, security conscious admins mount\nit nodev and nosuid.  If you\'re more careful, you can mount it noexec,\ntoo, but that will break some third-party software installers that\nwork by examining your system, writing a custom config script inside\n/tmp somewhere, and then running it.\n\n  So your fstab entry might look like:\n\n> /dev/with/temp/ /tmp ext3 nosuid,nodev 0 2 \n\n  \n> * is there anything Debian-specific to watch for?\n\n  Not that I recall.\n\n> * is it true that setting /tmp permissions to non-executable, while\n> hardening your box, prevents apt from working properly?\n\n  Setting /tmp to non-executable by the noexec mount option does break \nthings, but as I said above, my recollection is that it mostly breaks \nthird-party stuff.  I think the apt scripts are all in /var/lib/dkpg/info,\nand are run from there.\n  Setting the *directory* noexec seems very bad, since the exec bit\non directories controls the ability to cd to it, and turning that\noff would make it largely useless. \n\n  As to "why", on moderately-high-availability multi-user systems, I \noften put /tmp on a separate partition precisely so I can use mount\noptions to globally control access.  This is more important in a \ntruly multi-user system than a home system, of course.\n\n  Misbehaving apps rarely but sometimes blow the lid off of /tmp, and\nhaving it be on its own partition means this doesn\'t compromise the\nsystem as a whole, and you can easily figure out what\'s going on by \nseeing the logged errors and looking at "df" output.  Some folks keep\n/var/log on a separate partition for similar reasons.\n\n  Again, all of this is more important in a multi-user production \nenvironment.  On my home systems, I mostly don\'t worry about this\nsort of thing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-- A. \n-- \nAndrew Reid / reidac@bellatlantic.net\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
