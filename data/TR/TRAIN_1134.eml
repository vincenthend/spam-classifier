{'body': "I have an application that is designed to do something when the user \npauses over it with the mouse, especially when the java application is \nunfocused.  From what I can tell, on Mac OS X, unfocused Java windows \ndon't get mouse events.  Other applications in Cocoa seem to get this, \nso I'm curious: Is this a bug?  Or was Java for Mac OS X defined this \nway?  Is there a way to get these events?\n\n-- \nBrandon Moon<brandon@pixelture.com\nhttp://www.pixelture.com\n\nJoin us for EduComm 2010\nJune 7 - 9 Las Vegas\nwww.EducommConference.com\n\n _______________________________________________\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
