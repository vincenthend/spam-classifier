{'body': "I have an application that is designed to do something when the user \r\npauses over it with the mouse, especially when the java application is \r\nunfocused.  From what I can tell, on Mac OS X, unfocused Java windows \r\ndon't get mouse events.  Other applications in Cocoa seem to get this, \r\nso I'm curious: Is this a bug?  Or was Java for Mac OS X defined this \r\nway?  Is there a way to get these events?\r\n\r\n-- \r\nBrandon Moon<brandon@pixelture.com\r\nhttp://www.pixelture.com\r\n\r\nJoin us for EduComm 2010\r\nJune 7 - 9 Las Vegas\r\nwww.EducommConference.com\r\n\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
