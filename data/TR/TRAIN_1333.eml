But whether upstream software \nmeets users\' needs is out of Debian scope.

Given that KDE SC 4.5 might release with kdepim \nfrom 4.4 anyway extending kdepim 4.4 codebase lifetime to 1 year, beating dead \nhorse (4.3) makes absolutely no sense. I recommend you to face reality here.\n\n> These responses are quite frustrating.  I read Ana\'s post as "please make\n> sure KDE 4.4 is ready for stable".  My post was "KDE 4.4 is inappropriate\n> for stable".

Nothing objective and YOU \nassume that your truth is an ultimate one. Pet bugs are always RC to the \nreporter, but yet again, we need to face reality here. If YOU have so many \nproblems with particular piece of software, look for better options or read \nthe first part of this mail again.\n\n-- \nModestas Vainius <modestas@vainius.eu>\n', 'subject': 'Re: KDE 4.4.3 in unstable'}
