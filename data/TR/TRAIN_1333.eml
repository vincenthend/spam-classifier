But whether upstream softwar=\r\ne=20\r\nmeets users\' needs is out of Debian scope.

Given that KDE SC 4.5 might release with kdepi=\r\nm=20\r\nfrom 4.4 anyway extending kdepim 4.4 codebase lifetime to 1 year, beating d=\r\nead=20\r\nhorse (4.3) makes absolutely no sense.

My post was "KDE 4.4 is inappropriate\r\n> for stable".
