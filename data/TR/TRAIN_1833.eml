Some recent research points worth mentioning:\n\nRecent high-resolution studies of historical CO2 concentrations and\ntemperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest\ncorrelation between the two. In a number of cases, CO2 level increases\nare not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the\nincrease in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature\npreceded increases in CO2 concentrations. The more studies that are done\nof the geological record, the more it seems that CO2 concentrations are\ncorrelated with temperature increases, but are not significantly\ncausative. There is a lot of evidence that CO2 levels are regulated in a\nfairly stable fashion.  I don't believe anyone really has an\nauthoritative answer as to exactly how this works yet.\n\nWith respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to\npoint out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly\nregular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years.  At previous cycle\npeaks, the concentrations were similar to what they are now.  If this\ncycle has any validity (and we only have good data for 4-5 complete\ncyclical periods, but which look surprisingly regular in shape and\ntime), then we should be almost exactly at a peak right now.  As it\nhappens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous\ncyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data. In other\nwords, we may be adding to the CO2 levels, but it looks a lot like we\nwould be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical\nrecord.  At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2\nconcentrations.\n\nAlso, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately\naffects temperature.  Again, the interaction is not entirely\npredictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative\nfeedback systems mentioned above.\n\nLast, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn't particularly potent, although it\nmakes up for it in volume in some cases.  Gases such as water and\nmethane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule\nbasis.  Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas, something\nthat CO2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the\nbiosphere.\n\nCO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent\nstudies and data I've seen gives me the impression that it is largely a\npassenger on the climate ride rather than the driver.  I certainly don't\nthink it is a healthy fixation if we're actually interested in\nunderstanding warming trends.\n\nCheers,\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\n\n\n\n", 'subject': 'CO2 and climate (was RE: Goodbye Global Warming)'}
