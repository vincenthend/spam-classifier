I have plenty of those.)))\n\n"16:00\xa002\xa0August\xa002\n\n"A way to turn carbon dioxide into hydrocarbons has caused \na big stir at an industrial chemistry conference in New \nBrunwick, New Jersey. Nakamichi Yamasaki of the Tokushima \nIndustrial Technology Center in Japan says he has a \nprocess that makes propane and butane at relatively low \ntemperatures and pressures."\n\nLink: Yes, he actually exists:\nhttp://www.it.sakura.ne.jp/~koatsu/c_journal/ab/1_10/01-2.html\nhttp://www.itc.pref.tokushima.jp/English/eindex.html\n\n"Making fuel from greenhouse gases\n\n"While his work still needs independent verification,  \n(((okay, go fetch us some, then))) if he can make even \nheavier hydrocarbons, it might be possible to make petrol. \nIt has carbon chains that are between five and 12 atoms \nlong == butane is four atoms long.  ((("That\'s right, \nProfessor: I just hook it up to the sky and I make \ngasoline!")))\n\n   "The work suggests the tantalising prospect that CO2, \nthe main greenhouse gas, could be recycled instead of \nbeing pumped into the atmosphere.\n\n    "Many people have tried before to make hydrocarbons by \nmixing carbon with hydrogen gas in a reaction chamber at \nvery high temperatures, but yields have always been \npitiful. Yamasaki has used hydrochloric acid as his source \nof hydrogen ions. ((("But where are we s\'posed to get all \nthat hydrochloric acid?" Yes, I know, I know.)))\n\n    "He bubbles the CO2 into a reaction vessel where it is \nheated to about 300 C at 100 times atmospheric pressure. \nThe heat and pressure are low enough, says Yamasaki, to \nmake it feasible to scale up the reaction so it can run on \na power station\'s waste heat. (((Imagine the fun when a \ngiant tank of pressurized acid blows up.)))\n\n"Iron powder \n\n   "Using iron powder as a catalyst, Yamasaki says he has \nmade substantial amounts of methane, ethane, propane and \nbutane, which he was able to vent off as gases when the \nmixture cooled. If he can improve the catalyst\'s \nperformance he is hopeful of making heavier hydrocarbons \nsuch as petrol, too. \n\n    "William Siegfried, who has lead similar experiments \nat the University of Minnesota in the twin cities of \nMinneapolis and St Paul, says his group was only able to \nmake methane at far higher temperatures. But his process \nalso used a nickel-based alloy as a catalyst, rather than \niron.\n\n    "Siegfried\'s group was investigating whether natural \nmethane deposits might have formed chemically with the \nmetal in rocks acting as a catalyst rather than forming \nfrom the decay of rotting biological material over aeons.  \n(((Paging Thomas Gold! "Deep Hot Biosphere" calling on \nline one.)))\n\n   "Unless Yamasaki\'s technology can make the more \nvaluable heavier hydrocarbons such as petroleum, which are \nliquid at room temperature, it will not be much more use \nthan present-day bioreactors, in which bacteria that like \nto feed on CO2 are induced to produce methane. \'Organisms \nhave a special talent for that kind of reaction,\' says \nSiegfried.\n\nO=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O\nFED-EX IS HERE WITH\nYOUR WORLD-SAVING\nMIRACLE GIZMO\nO=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Viridian Note 00328: Fuel from CO2'}
