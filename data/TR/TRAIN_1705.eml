I see that in Lenny the ghostscript pj driver is used\r\nand in Squeeze they have switched to the hplis driver.  Perhaps upgrading\r\nto Squeeze may fix the problem.  In the meantime, I\'m going to do some\r\nexperimenting with the ghostscript driver directly and see what I can\r\nsee.\r\n\r\n--=20\r\n  .\'\'`.
