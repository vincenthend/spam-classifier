{'body': "Hi all,\n\nI'm trying to get Java1.6 working on my MacBook Pro 1,1 which has  \n10.5.8 on it. I've downloaded a package from the OpenJDK project, and  \nI've got it setup using the directions\nthat I've found at the bottom of this thread:\n\nhttp://www.mailarky.com/thread.php?page=1&id=197627\n\nwhere I've setup an OpenJDK6.jar folder in my ~/Library/Java/ \nJavaVirtualMachines directory. I've got the proper directory  \nstructure, but no luck in having it recognized by the\n/usr/libexec/java_home function. Nor is it recognized if I try to  \nsymlink it as a the 1.6.0 folder in the /System/Library/.../Versions  \npath. I think then the culprit may be my Info.plist\nfile.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with doing this setup? I've included  \nwhat my Info.plist looks like below to see if it's not formatted  \nproperly.\n\nThanks in advance.\n--\nMelih Onvural\nhttp://www.onvural.net/melih\n\n\nCFBundleDevelopmentRegion\nEnglish\nCFBundleIdentifier\ncom.example.OpenJDK\nCFBundleExecutable\nlibjava.dylib\nCFBundleInfoDictionaryVersion\n6.0\nCFBundleName\nOpenJDK 1.6.0\nCFBundlePackageType\nBNDL\nCFBundleShortVersionString\n1.0.0\nCFBundleSignature\n???\nCFBundleVersion\n1.0.0\nJavaVM\n\tJVMCapabilities\n\n\t\tCommandLine\n\n\tJVMPlatformVersion\n\t1.6\n\tJVMVersion\n\t1.6.0_00\n\n _______________________________________________\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
