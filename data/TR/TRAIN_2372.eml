{'body': 'Ananova: \nDracula theme park could be switched to Bucharest\n\nA controversial scheme to build a Dracula theme park in Romania could be\nswitched away from Transylvania.\nConsultants PricewaterhouseCoopers is now recommending that it be built in\nBucharest instead.\nIt comes after Prince Charles led international protests against the\noriginal proposals to build it in the medieval town of Sigishoara.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers name Bucharest, originally believed to be an outsider\nin the race to host the park, as the most profitable location for the\nproject.\nBut that has angered residents in Sigishoara, where Vlad the Impaler, the\ninspiration for Dracula, was born. They are counting on the park to boost\nthe local economy.\nEvenimentul Zilei reports that Sigishoara was placed behind the capital with\nthe Black Sea port of Constanta third choice.\nDorin Danesan, mayor of Sigishoara, said: "The pre-feasibility report from\nPWC shows that the park would attract more tourists if it was located in\nBucharest. But I still think that Sigishoara is the best location for it."\nThe park would include hotels, a Dracula roller coaster, catacombs, a ghost\ntrain and a house of horrors, as well as vampire dungeons located around a\nreconstruction of Dracula\'s castle and an artificial lake.\nThe project has also been objected to by the world heritage organisation\nUnesco fearing Sigishoara might be spoilt.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers is to present its final report on the project on\nOctober 15.\nStory filed: 13:16 Tuesday 8th October 2002\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
