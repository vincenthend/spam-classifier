{'body': 'URL: http://boingboing.net/#85482094\nDate: Not supplied\n\nJanis Ian, a brave and talented recording artist (and budding and talented \nscience fiction writer) has done a terrific interview with the Slashdot \ngroupmind about her views on the music industry. \n\n    Seriously, diversity is something record companies can\'t afford anymore - \n    not the majors, at any rate. I\'d go to this article, posted at Linux \n    Journal, which quotes a Newsweet article (July 15,2002) by Steven Levy \n    saying "So why are the record labels taking such a hard line? My guess is \n    that it\'s all about protecting their Internet-challenged business model. \n    Their profit comes from blockbuster artists. If the industry moved to a \n    more varied ecology, independent labels and artists would thrive--to the \n    detriment of the labels, which would have trouble rustling up the rubes to \n    root for the next Britney. The smoking gun comes from testimony of an \n    RIAA-backed economist who told the government fee panel that a dramatic \n    shakeout in Webcasting is "inevitable and desirable because it will bring \n    about market consolidation." That\'s really it in a nutshell. "Market \n    consolidation" means the less artists they have to promote, the less \n    ultimate dollars they\'ll spend. The smaller the playlist, the greater the \n    chance that audiences will buy something from that playlist alone - because \n    that\'s all you\'ll be able to find out there.  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2]\n\n[1] http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/09/23/133228\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/8nEQCxZaP8U6X\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Janis Ian interviewed on Slashdot'}
