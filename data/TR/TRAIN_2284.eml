But things are okay after bringing it\r\ndown (to 20MB).  You might want to try that.\r\n\r\nLarge cache slows Iceweasel down because it uses these large databases\r\nof stored history to suggest addresses in each tab\'s address bar.  I\r\nalso had a Zotero database, which used to worsen things.\r\n\r\nGirish.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nGirish Kulkarni - Allahabad, India - http://athene.org.in/girish\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
