If Habeas is going to die just because SA does not\nsupport it, that\'s a serious problem with the business model; but that is\nnobody\'s problem but Habeas\'s.\n\nA possible solution is for Habeas\'s business model to include some kind of\nincentive for users of SA to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I have yet\nto think of an incentive that fits the bill ...\n\nOn Thu, 29 Aug 2002, Justin Mason wrote:\n\n> I don\'t see a problem supporting it in SpamAssassin -- but I see Dan\'s\n> points.\n> \n>   - high score: as far as I can see, that\'s because SpamAssassin is\n>     assigning such high scores to legit newsletters these days, and the\n>     Habeas mark has to bring it down below that. :(   IMO we have to fix\n>     the high-scorers anyway -- no spam ever *needs* to score over 5 in our\n>     scoring system, 5 == tagged anyway.\n\nThis is off the topic of the rest of this discussion, but amavisd (in all\nits incarnations) and MIMEDefang and several other MTA plugins all reject\nat SMTP time messages that scores higher than some threshold (often 10).  \nIf some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 5.1,\nthere\'d better be _zero_ FPs, because all those filters would drop their\nthresholds to 5.\n\nOn Thu, 29 Aug 2002, Michael Moncur wrote:\n\n> But I agree that there needs to be more focus on eliminating rules that\n> frequently hit on newsletters.

Habeas is priced way too high -- a factor\nof at least 20 over what the market will bear, IMO -- on a per-message\nbasis for most typical mailing lists (Lockergnome, say) to afford it.\n\nOn Thu, 29 Aug 2002, Harold Hallikainen wrote:\n\n> Habeus has come up with a very clever way to use existing law to battle\n> spam.

There\'s nobody\nleft to charge except the people who want (or are forced against their\nwill because their mail won\'t get through otherwise) to use the mark.\n\nConversely, if there are enough spammers forging the mark for Habeas to\nmake all its income suing them, then the mark is useless for the purpose\nfor which it was designed.\n\nEither way it seems to me that, after maybe a couple of lawsuits against\nreal spammers and a lot of cease-and-desist letters to clueless Mom&Pops,\nthen either (a) they\'re out of business, (b) they have to sell the rights\nto use the mark to increasingly questionable senders, or (c) they\'ve both\ncreated and monopolized a market for "internet postage stamps" that\neverybody has to pay them for.\n\nThe latter would be quite a coup if they [*] could pull it off -- they do\nabsolutely nothing useful, unless you consider threatening people with\nlawsuits useful, yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly\nfrom everyone on the internet -- effectively we\'ll be paying them for the\nprivilege of policing their trademark for them.  I don\'t believe they\'ll\never get that far, but I don\'t particularly want to help them make it.\n\n[*] And I use the term "they" loosely, because the whole company could \nconsist of one lawyer if it really got to that point.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nSpamassassin-talk mailing list\nSpamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: [SAtalk] O.T.
