{'body': "I knew it'd be a day for insanity.\n\nso anyway, news.com decided to write up two wonderful articles on the\nDMCA and decided to link to decss.exe, the very verboten code that\nended up getting 2600 (but none of the other news services that\noriginally linked) spanked.\n\nSlashdot, of course, links to them.\n\nSo now, I link to slashdot.\n\nhttp://slashdot.org/articles/02/10/07/1331217.shtml?tid=123\n\nI find this all incredibly funny really.  Congress _and_ the courts\nrelaly do need to be considering how laws such as the DMCA are\napplied.  For the most part, these rules are coming down to whose\nfriend you happen to be, how nefarious the defendant party is, and how\nasleep the judge is behind the case (asleep/self-interested/bought).\nIts giving me a real cynical view on being a lawyer, thats for sure.\n\n\n\n-- \nBest regards,\n bitbitch                          mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net\n\n\n", 'subject': 'And yet more absurdity.'}
