For example, when someone sends email to\ncoolapps@linuxcare.com to suggest a program for me to review [pardon the\nblatant plug...], it forwards to me. When I hit reply, the From: line in\nthe email will contain coolapps@linuxcare.com instead of my main address\nbneely@linuxcare.com. My .muttrc file accomplishes this with two lines:\n\nset alternates = "kbeditor@linuxcare.com|coolapps@linuxcare.com"\nset reverse_name\n\n**************************************************************************\n\nOn Tue, 30 Jul 2002, David Neary wrote:\n\n> I have 3 or 4 email addresses (which get used for different\n> reasons), and I\'d prefer not to mix them up.
