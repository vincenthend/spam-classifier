The fact that you see it in the package\nfile name means that it did not recognize the option.  Try it this way:\n\n   fakeroot make-kpkg clean\n   fakeroot make-kpkg --append-to-version -recompiled --revision x.x.xxx \\\n    --initrd kernel_image kernel_headers\n\nNote: you must always issue "make-kpkg clean" after running "make menuconfig"\nor after running "make-kpkg" with any target other than "clean".  Otherwise,\nversion and revision numbers will not work as expected.  Assuming that you\nare using official Debian kernel sources, you will want to make the value\nfor --revision match the "version" of the linux-source-2.6.32 package.\nI know the web page I pointed you to is long and boring.  But the answers to\nall of your problems are in there.  Where did you get your kernel sources,\nby the way?  And why are you compiling a custom kernel in the first place?\n\n-- \n  .\'\'`.
