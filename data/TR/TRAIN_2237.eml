I thought this would be a good time to see what kind of\ngrades Lindows.com received for their first 9 months in operation..\n\n<http://lindows.com/timeline> \nTo view the Timeline of Lindows.com\'s first 9 months in business, click\nhere <http://lindows.com/timeline> . \n\nOperating System:  \n\nAs of last week, consumers can experience LindowsOS in one of two ways.\nOne way is to buy a computer running LindowsOS from Walmart.com\n<http://www.lindows.com/walmart> , for as little as $299. This is a\nsignificant milestone for us, as we\'ve partnered with our first builder\n(Microtel) and retailer (Walmart). These computers work great out of the\nbox and are ideal for general purpose computing tasks. \n\nFor those who already have a computer and also wish to try LindowsOS, we\noffer the Insider program <http://www.lindows.com/signup> . This gives\npeople wanting early access to LindowsOS a chance to try out LindowsOS\nas it develops. Currently, Insiders report installation success about\n80%  of the time on their PCs. Therefore we have some room to grow,\nconsequently, this product is not yet for everyone. \n\nSome may wonder how we can sell a computer at Walmart\n<http://www.lindows.com/walmart> when the program available directly\nfrom Lindows.com is billed as not completely ready. The difference is\nthe Walmart <http://www.lindows.com/walmart>  computers are certified,\nensuring that all components  work elegantly with LindowsOS. That\'s much\ndifferent than offering a software program that will work on any\ncomputer in the world - that\'s very difficult. It\'s the difference\nbetween making a single pair of shoes for a known foot size versus\nopening a shoe store with every style of shoe for every size foot. The\nfirst one is easy, the second one is a much bigger job.\n\nWhile the installer is fantastically easy and fast (the entire OS\ninstalls in under 5 minutes), we\'ve got a lot more work to do to support\na wider range of hardware, printers and other devices. Grade:  B\n  _____  \n\nSoftware: \n\nOur goal to give people choice means giving them choice not just on\ntheir operating system, but access to all the programs they\'ll want to\nadd to their computer to really make it work for them in their school,\nhome or business.\n\nClick-N-Run <http://www.lindows.com/clicknrun>  is the easiest way to\nload software onto a computer. For the first time a Linux based system\nhas leapt ahead of Microsoft\'s operating systems in ease of use. With\n1,000 plus programs already in the Click-N-Run Warehouse\n<http://www.lindows.com/warehouse> , users can find quality software\ntitles for just about any computing task and, with a single mouse-click\ndownload, install and run these programs. All these titles are included\nin the $99. This is a fantastic consumer experience and price point.\nLook for a lot more great software in the Warehouse in the future.\nGrade: A-\n  _____  \n\nMicrosoft Windows Compatibility:\n\nWe live in a Microsoft world, so there needs to be a bridge from the\nlegacy world to the broadband LindowsOS world. This means we need to\nsupport some bridge programs, file types and network devices to help\npeople interact with the legacy Microsoft world. LindowsOS computers\ncome with software to view, print and copy popular Microsoft\napplications like: MS Word files, MS PowerPoint files and MS Excel\ndocuments. There\'s great Linux based alternatives and we\'ll guide people\nto those alternatives (they\'re better than most people realize). To edit\nMicrosoft files, we\'d highly recommend one of the office suites in our\nWarehouse such as OpenOffice\n<http://www.lindows.com/lindows_products_details.php?id=8966> . \n\nMany of these programs are of very high-quality and a great value since\nthey\'re included in the Warehouse <http://www.lindows.com/warehouse> .\nSometimes there are no viable alternatives for those programs, so we\'re\ninvesting necessary resources to support some Microsoft Windows based\nprograms. Stay tuned for more developments in this area. Our printer\nsupport is ok, but there\'s lots of room for more drivers. Connecting to\nMS Windows based file servers is still a challenge. We need to get\nbetter in the above areas.  Grade: B \n  _____  \n\nCommunication:\n\nWe\'ve tried to be diligent in communicating where our company is going\nwhich is why there\'s typically a weekly Michael\'s Minute\n<http://www.lindows.com/mm> . While our overall goal has not deviated -\nBringing Choice To Your Computer - our implementation has become more\nfocused as we listened to what our Insiders and potential customers have\ntold us. (Keep sending me your comments.) We have been de-emphasizing\nrunning Microsoft Windows programs because many of you told us you\ndetest spending hundreds of dollars on individual software programs,\nforced upgrades and activation codes. It\'s not just the operating\nsystem, but costly Microsoft programs you\'re wanting to avoid. \n\nConsequently, we\'ve been emphasizing Click-N-Run because it will change\nthe way you think about software. Having a neatly categorized library\n<http://www.lindows.com/warehouse>  of 1,000+ software titles all for a\nflat annual fee at your digital fingertips is an entirely new way to\nthink about paying for software. It\'s immediate, elegant and affordable.\n\nThere are lots of mischaracterizations about Lindows.com swirling around\n- which happens when you have a small organization which can\'t address\nevery question or publication. We\'ll do a better job of addressing these\nin the future. For now, I wrote up answers to the Top Myths about\nLindows.com. Check them out by visiting: www.lindows.com/myths  Grade:\nB+\n  _____  \n\nOverall: B+\n\nMichael Robertson\n\nPlease visit support.lindows.com <http://support.lindows.com/>  to\nanswer questions you may have about LindowsOS or Lindows.com.\n\nBringing Choice to Your Computer! \n \nLindowsOS is presently available on LindowsOS Certified Computers being\noffered from Lindows.com  <http://www.lindows.com/builder> Builder\npartners.  The General Release of LindowsOS (available now for download\nand preview to Lindows.com  <http://lindows.com/signup> Insider\npartners) will be made available later this year for those wishing to\ninstall and run LindowsOS on their existing computer hardware.  The\nGeneral Release version will support a wider range of computer hardware\nand includes unique features such as a "Friendly-Install" alongside an\nexisting MicrosoftR Windows operating system, a streamlined installation\nprocess which requires no computer knowledge, and the ability to run a\nselect set of "bridge" Windows-compatible programs.
