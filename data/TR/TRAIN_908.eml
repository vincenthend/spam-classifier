Thanks.\r\n\r\n=46irst you need a (basic) regular expression (BRE) that matches "\\paragrap=\r\nh{}". =20\r\nThe \'\\\' is a BRE special character, so it needs to be escaped.  Also, the "=\r\n{}"=20\r\nis a bit troublesome with find/-exec, so we will match it using the constru=\r\nct=20\r\n"[{][}]".\r\n\r\nThe definitive documentation for regular expression is the Single UNIX=20\r\nSpecification, Version 3 -- Base Definitions, Chapter 9.  I don\'t actually=\r\n=20\r\nlike (man 7 regex) for this.\r\n\r\nThis gives us the regex "\\\\paragraph[{][}]".  Now, we need to get that regu=\r\nlar=20\r\nexpression to sed.  (find $dir -type f -exec sed -i -e "s/\\\\paragraph[{][}]=\r\n//"=20\r\n{} \\;) won\'t work, since during Quote Removal, one of the \'\\\'s are dropped =\r\nand=20\r\nneither find nor sed "sees" it.\r\n\r\nThe shell does a *lot* of processing to the text you type before it reaches=\r\n=20\r\nthe command you are invoking.  Single UNIX Specification, Version 3 -- Shel=\r\nl=20\r\nand Utilities, Chapter 2 is the core documentation, but some shells are muc=\r\nh=20\r\nmore featureful.\r\n\r\nWe can either use (find $dir -type f -exec sed -i -e \'s/\\\\paragraph[{][}]//=\r\n\'=20\r\n{} \\;) OR--my preference--(regex=3D\'\\\\paragraph[{][}]\'; find $dir -type f -=\r\nexec=20\r\nsed -i -e "s/$regex//" {} \\;) to make sure sed gets that important \'\\\'.\r\n\r\nAlso, I left it out, but you may want the "g" flag to the "s"ubstitute comm=\r\nand=20\r\nin sed.  Otherwise, only one occurrence of the regex will get eliminated pe=\r\nr=20\r\nline.\r\n=2D-=20\r\nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr.           \t ,=3D ,-_-. =3D.\r\nbss@iguanasuicide.net            \t((_/)o o(\\_))\r\nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy \t `-\'(. .)`-\'\r\nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/        \t     \\_/\r\n', 'subject': 'Re: Deleting some regexp/simple expression from lots of files in a secure way'}
