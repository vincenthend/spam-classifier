Thanks.\n\nFirst you need a (basic) regular expression (BRE) that matches "\\paragraph{}".  \nThe \'\\\' is a BRE special character, so it needs to be escaped.  Also, the "{}" \nis a bit troublesome with find/-exec, so we will match it using the construct \n"[{][}]".\n\nThe definitive documentation for regular expression is the Single UNIX \nSpecification, Version 3 -- Base Definitions, Chapter 9.  I don\'t actually \nlike (man 7 regex) for this.\n\nThis gives us the regex "\\\\paragraph[{][}]".  Now, we need to get that regular \nexpression to sed.  (find $dir -type f -exec sed -i -e "s/\\\\paragraph[{][}]//" \n{} \\;) won\'t work, since during Quote Removal, one of the \'\\\'s are dropped and \nneither find nor sed "sees" it.\n\nThe shell does a *lot* of processing to the text you type before it reaches \nthe command you are invoking.  Single UNIX Specification, Version 3 -- Shell \nand Utilities, Chapter 2 is the core documentation, but some shells are much \nmore featureful.\n\nWe can either use (find $dir -type f -exec sed -i -e \'s/\\\\paragraph[{][}]//\' \n{} \\;) OR--my preference--(regex=\'\\\\paragraph[{][}]\'; find $dir -type f -exec \nsed -i -e "s/$regex//" {} \\;) to make sure sed gets that important \'\\\'.\n\nAlso, I left it out, but you may want the "g" flag to the "s"ubstitute command \nin sed.  Otherwise, only one occurrence of the regex will get eliminated per \nline.\n-- \nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr.           \t ,= ,-_-. =.\nbss@iguanasuicide.net            \t((_/)o o(\\_))\nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy \t `-\'(. .)`-\'\nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/        \t     \\_/\n', 'subject': 'Re: Deleting some regexp/simple expression from lots of files in a secure way'}
