Just saying "crucial hair feature" \nimproves my day immeasurably.\n\nI\'ve done a fair amount of thinking about the "media intermediated" meeting \nthing.   It seriously loses for reasons like Rohit\'s just encountered.   \nOne is both rejected for trivial reasons and rejects for the same.\nSome people loudly defend that these choices are not trivial.\n\nI\'d have never met my best friend if I had to pick her out of a crowd for \ngetting to know.   I was a teen at the time, but I won\'t say I\'m much \nimproved at being able to spot "interesting" at a distance.   Interesting \nisn\'t an external thing.  I have that brought home to me again every so \noften.  I may think that interesting people dress differently or whatever, \nbut that\'s total superstition.   How do I know what your version of \ncreative attire is?  Maybe it\'s purely functional.\n\nI was at a loud party recently, sufficiently loud that conversation of any \nkind was extremely difficult, and intoxication was the norm.   I was \nworking on what my algorithm for meeting people there should be and one of \nthe candidates was "women, in order of attractiveness."   I flinched from \nthat, rather violently.   At a trade show, or something, I might elect to \ntalk to the people who are looking at interesting exhibits.   At a \nparty.....well, if you can\'t hear the conversation they are having, or if \non the net all you have is a photo.....\n\nYou just can\'t tell important things from a picture and a few words.  It\'s \nnot how we are built.   There\'s no geek code for the heart and soul.\n(And if there were people would lie and game the system.)\nIt\'s too easy to say "Oh, no!  He\'s a geek!"   or "She\'s a CAT person, \nick!" when you might have a great time together.\n\nWe are constructed to form alliances based on how we fit together as \npeople, how we feel in the other person\'s company, how well we partner on \ntasks and recreation.   This is all entirely speculative based on nothing \nbut superstitious association unless you actually have time in the \nperson\'s company.   Which is why we tend to be screwed when our circle of \nexposure shrinks after school.\n\nPersonally, as a writer, the whole internet meet & email thing ought to \nwork better for me than it does for other people, but interestingly, it \ndoesn\'t.   I have to put out the same amount of effort and reap about the \nsame poor results.    I have to think it\'s not the people, but the tool.\n\nAn aside (okay, yes, I\'m a tool geek):  Speed Dating\nSpeed Dating (aka 7 Minute Dating) is a live-action stab at actual time in \nthe company of a variety of people, compressed into one event.   I think \nit\'s noticably better, but still absolutely nothing like working on a \nproject together, cooking, climbing a mountain or whatever.\nIt was, in fact, invented as a jewish thing seeking to match up the young \npeople to avoid total assimilation.   It has too much "interview" context \nand no shared activity beyond that.   I give it several points for effort \nthough. \n\nI guess my impression that even the Speed Dating thing doesn\'t do much for \nyou means that the traditional advice of "join activities groups" is \nactually sound.\n\nEirikur\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: [VoID] a new low on the personals tip...'}
