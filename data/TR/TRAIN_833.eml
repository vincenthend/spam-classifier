{'body': b'Hi,\n\nsome time now the following messages were haunting me:\n\n     automount[11593]: attempting to mount entry /home/dude\n\nIt just came to my attention, that only freshrpm benefitting hosts showed this\nup. I grepped through the binaries and found referrences to /home/dude.\n\n# grep /home/dude /usr/bin/*\nBinary file /usr/bin/aaxine matches\nBinary file /usr/bin/gentoo matches\nBinary file /usr/bin/gphoto2 matches\nBinary file /usr/bin/gtkam matches\n...\n\nI am now relaxed again ;), and pass this info on. Probably Matthias Saou\nhimself is "dude", and some package has hardwired a path in his build\ndirectory. It would be nice to find out which and fix it, but I am using too\nmany of the freshrpm suite to narrow it down.\n\nRegards, Axel.\n-- \nAxel.Thimm@physik.fu-berlin.de\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n', 'subject': '/home/dude'}
