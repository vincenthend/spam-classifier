In a world where the Macs all ran emulated 68K code \nutterly reliably, it\'s just hard to accept that there can\'t be a single \nportable JVM that just works.\n\nMy opinion is biased because of the disgraceful state of non-Windoze \nbrowser java implementations.\n\nEirikur\n\n\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: Java is for kiddies'}
