{'body': 'I have been trying to research via SA mirrors and search engines if a canned\nscript exists giving clients access to their user_prefs options via a\nweb-based CGI interface. Numerous ISPs provide this feature to clients, but\nso far I can find nothing. Our configuration uses Amavis-Postfix and ClamAV\nfor virus filtering and Procmail with SpamAssassin for spam filtering. I\nwould prefer not to have to write a script myself, but will appreciate any\nsuggestions.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old\ncell phone?
