Most\nsystems you just add a flag and memory is tracked (that\'s how i\'ve always\ndone it) or worst case yuo have to run it through one of the 2.3E7 tools\nwhere you simply recompile and it it tells you where the leaks are.\n\nMemory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any idea at all how the\nhardware functions. Granted, this takes 30 minutes to go over, and so is far\nbeyond the scope of the "Learn Java in 90 minutes without thinking" book\nevery Java programmer learned from.\n\n- Adam L.
