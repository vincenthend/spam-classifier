It does not happen with standard usb flash \ndisk, though.\n\n> step 3.\n> # mount\n\n(...)\n\nWhich means it has been umounted.\n\nI get the same behaviour than you, but only when I attach a special \ndevice (GNOME recognizes the mobile phone as some kind of music stuff). \n\nTry this:\n\n1/ Plug on the device\n2/ Type mount (to get the device listed)\n3/ Type "umount /media/video" (adjust the command to point the right path)\n4/ Type "mount"\n\nWith these steps I get no pop-up or warning messages and the device gets \numounted normally.\n\nGreetings,\n\n-- \nCamalen\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
