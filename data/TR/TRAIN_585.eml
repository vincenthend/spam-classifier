It\'s=\r\n=20\r\nlikely that something "behind-the-scenes" in LVM is actually messing with t=\r\nhe=20\r\nsnapshot device even when it is not mounted and preventing the removal.\r\n\r\nI\'m fairly sure the snapshot device has to be updated whenever a write is d=\r\none=20\r\nto a new LE in the original device, and it\'s possible *that* is causing the=\r\n=20\r\nproblem.  I hope this issue gets some attention; I doubt it is a Debian-ism.\r\n\r\n> I\'ve also been hit by this, although it *may* be harmless (or not -\r\n> this stuff could really use decent documentation):\r\n>=20\r\n> http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=3D503268\r\n\r\nMy guess on this one is one of two things:\r\n1) Udev is taking a little while to unlink "secondary" names for the LVs th=\r\nat=20\r\nare being removed, and when lvm does its device scan it\'s hitting "missing"=\r\n=20\r\ndevices.\r\n2) LVM is using device names from its cache for devices that are no longer=\r\n=20\r\npresent for its device scan and, again, hitting "missing" devices.\r\n\r\nIn either case I think the error messages are annoying, but not indicative =\r\nof=20\r\na real problem.\r\n=2D-=20\r\nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr.           \t ,=3D ,-_-. =3D.\r\nbss@iguanasuicide.net            \t((_/)o o(\\_))\r\nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy \t `-\'(. .)`-\'\r\nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/        \t     \\_/\r\n', 'subject': 'Re: backing up LVM volumes'}
