If \nI understand you:  If I don\'t use the "nomime" => 1 option and I recieve \nMIME mail, the Mail::Internet modules become unavailable.\n\nUnavailable for which?  MA?  SA?  What do these methods do?  Does this \nmean my incoming MIME mail won\'t be checked by SA unless I specify \n"nomime" => 1?\n\nThanks,\nPhil\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: [SAtalk] testing the install'}
