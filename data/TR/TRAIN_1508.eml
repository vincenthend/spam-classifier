You can use it with vars (and then the\nnormal form is sizeof var, not sizeof(var)), but if you\'re changing the\ntype with the var with a cast, of course you\'ll get the size of that new\ntype.\n\nRegards,\nLuciano Rocha\n\n-- \nConsciousness: that annoying time between naps.\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: Are bad developer libraries the problem with M$ software?'}
