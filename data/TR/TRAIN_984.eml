If untrusted strangers\nare relaying spam through your qmail server, it\'s a fair bet that\nyou\'ve seriously botched your qmail config (like forgetting to create\nan rcpthosts file or something).\n\nAnyway, if you insist on using razor to resolve this problem, I\nwould suggest tossing qmail-scanner <http://qmail-scanner.sf.net/>\nand SpamAssassin <http://www.spamassassin.org/> into the mix as well.\nThe former provides the qmail-integration framework on which the latter\ndoes its work (including razor-check invocations).\n\nFair warning: It\'ll be far more resource-intensive than simply denying\nrelaying privileges to everyone except the folks you trust.  To find\nout how to do that, go to <http://www.qmail.org/> (which, incidentally,\nshould be your first stop for all things qmail) and search for "qmail\nnewbie\'s guide to relaying".\n\n- Adrian\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: Dice - The leading online job board\nfor high-tech professionals.
