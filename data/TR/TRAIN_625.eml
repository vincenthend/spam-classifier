The same thing that any beta project needs to improve.\nContinuous\nEnd-User testing, constructive feedback, and suggestions on how to improve\nthe\nsystem.  Upgrade each time a new beta version comes out, so everyone is\ntesting\non the same version of the code, and old bugs don\'t get reported as being in\nthe\nnew version, thus slowing down the debugging process.\n\nReport any installation issues, bugs, errors, etc., to the V2 beta list\n(http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-testers) so that they can\nbe quickly\nlooked at, etc.  Provide detailed description of issues, include logs if\npossible,\nas well as any "captured" spam that generated the error(s).\n\n\nThank you, please drive through,\n- AA -\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nRazor-users mailing list\nRazor-users@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-users\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: [Razor-users] Authentication Error'}
