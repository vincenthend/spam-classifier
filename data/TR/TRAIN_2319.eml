(where ... might be \'openjdk\'?), files in /lib \r\nor /usr/lib that are not library files, etc. could either be the source, \r\nor point to other files to check.\r\n\r\nThis is a \'brute force\' sort of technique, but it has helped me in a \r\ncouple of cases where all else had failed.\r\n\r\nBob\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
