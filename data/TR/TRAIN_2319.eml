(where ... might be \'openjdk\'?), files in /lib \nor /usr/lib that are not library files, etc. could either be the source, \nor point to other files to check.\n\nThis is a \'brute force\' sort of technique, but it has helped me in a \ncouple of cases where all else had failed.\n\nBob\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
