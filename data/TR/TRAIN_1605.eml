I think the current problem is that there are\nvery few really good nice tests in the current rulebase, and lots\nof +ve tests that those newsletters hit, giving the GA a big\nproblem to solve.\n\n--j.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old\ncell phone?
