Its use would be more like\nenabling/disabling gpg, ldap, whateversql support in packages as it\'s not\npossible to use something like "--with-<foo>=<bar>" which could be used for\na much wider scope.\n\nMatthias\n\n-- \nClean custom Red Hat Linux rpm packages : http://freshrpms.net/\nRed Hat Linux release 7.3 (Valhalla) running Linux kernel 2.4.18-10\nLoad : 0.00 0.12 0.32, AC on-line, battery charging: 100% (4:47)\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: --with ...'}
