Basically, you\'ll then just be sure that it\'s me\nwho generated the files, and this will of course prevent automating the\nprocess of updating the apt repository when Red Hat updates show up.\n\nIn Red Hat Linux 8.0 though, the warnings about "No Key" appear until you\nimport the right gpg public keys directly with rpm, for example :\nrpm --import /usr/share/doc/apt-0.5.4cnc7/RPM-GPG-KEY\n(this will import my key, which is used to sign all freshrpms.net packages)\n\nHopefully it is possible to the tell rpm to install *only* packages who\nverify against an imported gpg key? This for me would be the optimal way to\nensure integrity with the way things curently work.\n\nMatthias\n\n-- \nClean custom Red Hat Linux rpm packages : http://freshrpms.net/\nRed Hat Linux release 7.3 (Valhalla) running Linux kernel 2.4.18-10acpi\nLoad : 0.14 0.18 0.17\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n', 'subject': "Re: Apt repository authentication: it's time"}
