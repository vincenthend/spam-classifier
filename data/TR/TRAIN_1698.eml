{'body': 'Depends on how much over spending vs. how much (and what type) over\nregulation.\n\nThe biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible.\nIt also has the ability to single out particular people, while over\nspending spreads the damage more evenly.  Rent control would be an\nexample of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spending\ntons of money on public housing.\n\nAs for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to impose\nboth, I find no fault in that definition whatsoever.  The opinion that\nEITHER we are spending too much OR we have too much regulation is pretty\nmuch anathema to liberal politics.\n\nFinally, those who argue that there are private replacements for much\ngovernment regulation are not saying that a state of nature (no private\nreplacements, no government regulation) is better than government\nregulation itself.\n\nAnd in my experience people who label themselves \'Green\' (which does not\ninclude everyone who loves trees and thinks smokestacks are ugly) is a\nwatermelon.\n\n\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of\nGeege\n> Schuman\n> \n> funny. i read it as green = red, as in accounting, as in fiscally\n> irresponsible.  which do you think is the worse indictment -\n> overregulation\n> or overspending?  there are many (dickheads) who buy into the\n> neo-conservative media\'s (fox\'s) definiton of "liberal" as "one who\nseeks\n> to\n> impose both."\n\n\n', 'subject': 'liberal defnitions'}
