With the ever changing face of spam,\nthis would probably be a big benefit to SA users and help keep everyone up\nto date.  We have not done this with too many of the apps we sell on\nwww.RoseCitySoftware.com strictly because of joe-average-user concerns\nabout spyware and "phoning home", but in cases where the app needs to\naccess the internet anyhow, we have done it with great success and minimal\nconcern by our users.\n\n----\nJoseph Burke\nPresident/CEO\nInfiniSource, Inc.\n<jburke@infinisource.com> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nIn remembrance\nwww.osdn.com/911/\n_______________________________________________\nSpamassassin-talk mailing list\nSpamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk\n\n\n', 'subject': '[SAtalk] Re: Spamassassin-talk digest, Vol 1 #659 - 41 msgs'}
