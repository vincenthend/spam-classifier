Hewlett-Packard Co has a Utility Data Center, designed for\n  broader management. International Business Machines Corp\'s project eLiza is working\n  to make computers "self-healing" when systems break.\n\n  "Applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the\n  whole idea behind N1 is you stop thinking about that. You don\'t think about what box\n  it is running on," Sun Vice President Steve MacKay, head of the N1 program, said in an\n  interview on the sidelines of a Sun user conference. \n\n  Many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or\n  water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever\n  needed. \n  For that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly, rather than cobbling\n  them together with tenuous links, as most networks do today, experts say. There are\n  still major barriers, though, such as communications standards for machines from\n  different vendors to interoperate closely. \n  Sun promised to deliver a "virtualization engine" that would let administrators look at\n  their entire network as a pool by the end of the year. Network administrators today\n  often have no automatic system to report what is in the network. \n\n  "It\'ll tell you what you have and how it is laid out," promised MacKay\n  The second stage, beginning in 2003, would allow users to identify a service, such as\n  online banking, and allocate resources for them with a few clicks, Sun said. \n  Finally, in 2004, Sun\'s software should allow networks to change uses of resources on\n  the fly in response to changing needs, such as a bank assuring quicker online response\n  time for priority users, the company said.\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Sun'}
