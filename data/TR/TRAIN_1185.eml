A digital signature\nis worth sqrat if any userspace app or rogue superuser code can grab your\nkeyring in clear, and send out stuff in your name.

You don't use a passphrase to read your email. Unless it resides \non a crypto file system.\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n", 'subject': 'Re: Forged whitelist spam'}
