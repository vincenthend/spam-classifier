A proposed law based on the discussion \ndraft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in \nearly 2003.\n\nArguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, \nCanadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and \ncombat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting \nthese proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the \nCouncil of Europe\'s cybercrime treaty \n<http://news.com.com/2100-1001-268894.html>, which the country is in the \nprocess of considering.\n\nIf the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the \npossession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet \nproviders to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and \npermit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find "hidden \nelectronic and digital devices" that a suspect might be concealing. In \nmost circumstances, a court order would be required for government \nagents to conduct Internet monitoring.\n\nCanada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of \nEurope, and representatives from both countries\' police agencies have \nendorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty \n<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/CadreListeTraites.htm>, which has \ndrawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. \nOf nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted \n<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/searchsig.asp?NT=185&CM=8&DF=27/08/02>, \nor ratified, the treaty.\n\nMichael Geist <http://aix1.uottawa.ca/%7Egeist/>, a professor at the \nUniversity of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the \njustification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems \nweak.\n\n"It seems to me that the main justification they\'ve given for all the \nchanges is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to \nmake changes," Geist said. "To me that\'s not a particularly convincing \nargument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, \nmake that case."\n\nGeist added that "there\'s nothing in the document that indicates (new \npowers) are needed. I don\'t know that there have been a significant \nnumber of cases where police have run into problems."\n\nProbably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is \ncompelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure \ntheir networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention \norders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the \nCommunications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act \n<http://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/calea/calea_law.html>, but it \napplies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.\n\n"It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and \nInternet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical \ncapability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national \nsecurity agencies," according to the proposal. Companies would be \nresponsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.\n\nSarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center \n<http://www.epic.org/> (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says \nthe proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. "Their \nproposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not \njust Internet providers," Andrews said. "The cybercrime treaty deals \nonly with computer data." EPIC opposes \n<http://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/cybercrime/coe/ngo_letter_601.htm> \nthe cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and \ndoes not adequately respect privacy rights.\n\nAnother section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs \nof Police recommends "the establishment of a national database" with \npersonal information about all Canadian Internet users. "The \nimplementation of such a database would presuppose that service \nproviders are compelled to provide accurate and current information," \nthe draft says.\n\nGus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an \nactivist with Privacy International, calls the database "a dumb idea."\n\n"Immediately you have to wonder if you\'re allowed to use anonymous \nmobile phones or whether you\'re allowed to connect to the Internet \nanonymously," Hosein said.\n\nA representative for George Radwanski \n<http://www.privcom.gc.ca/au_e.asp>, Canada\'s privacy commissioner, said \nthe office is reviewing the blueprint and does not "have any comments on \nthe paper as it stands."\n\nComments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca \n<mailto:la-al@justice.gc.ca> no later than Nov. 15.\n\n\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Canadians again - something a little more substantive'}
