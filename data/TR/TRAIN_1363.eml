Unfortunately the case where a transitional\npackage A pulls in another package B is not handled well by the package\nmanagers, I always end up "aptitude unmarkauto B; aptitude markauto A"\nto tell apt that I want to keep the new package and that it can remove\nthe transitional one as soon as nothing depends on it anymore.\n\n> The following NEW packages will be installed:\n> ... grub-pc{a} ...\n>\n> So why does aptitude pay no attention to my pin?\n\nBecause it decides that the grub-legacy package is unused and can be\nremoved despite the pin.  Whether this is the right thing is debatable;\nI\'m sure you find some bug reports about that if you dig into the long\nlist of aptitude bugs.\n\nSven\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
