Unfortunately the case where a transitional\r\npackage A pulls in another package B is not handled well by the package\r\nmanagers, I always end up "aptitude unmarkauto B; aptitude markauto A"\r\nto tell apt that I want to keep the new package and that it can remove\r\nthe transitional one as soon as nothing depends on it anymore.\r\n\r\n> The following NEW packages will be installed:\r\n> ... grub-pc{a} ...\r\n>\r\n> So why does aptitude pay no attention to my pin?\r\n\r\nBecause it decides that the grub-legacy package is unused and can be\r\nremoved despite the pin.  Whether this is the right thing is debatable;\r\nI\'m sure you find some bug reports about that if you dig into the long\r\nlist of aptitude bugs.\r\n\r\nSven\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
