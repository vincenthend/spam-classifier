I use "Caps Lock" since I do not use that key\r\notherwise, but you can choose any of the keys available.\r\n\r\nOnce you have a compose key defined you can enter the power of two\r\ncharacter by typing: <compose> ^ 2\r\n\r\nThis is three separate key presses. You do not hold down the compose\r\nkey.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe". Trouble?
