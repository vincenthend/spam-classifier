I use "Caps Lock" since I do not use that key\notherwise, but you can choose any of the keys available.\n\nOnce you have a compose key defined you can enter the power of two\ncharacter by typing: <compose> ^ 2\n\nThis is three separate key presses. You do not hold down the compose\nkey.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe". Trouble?
