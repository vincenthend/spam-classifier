{'body': 'Just got this ... I was just reading mail, but in a very dark\nroom, where the keyboard is illuminated mostly by the light from\nthe (laptop) screen.   I think I put my fingers on the wrong keys.\n(I mostly use the keyboard exclusively while running exmh).\n\nThis is from today\'s cvs (the fixes for the problems I mentioned\nyesterday are included) - I eventually managed to contact the cvs\nserver.\n\nexpected integer but got ""\n    while executing\n"incr m"\n    (procedure "MhSeqExpand" line 12)\n    invoked from within\n"MhSeqExpand $folder $msgids"\n    (procedure "MhSeq" line 2)\n    invoked from within\n"MhSeq $folder $seq $how $oldmsgids $msgids"\n    (procedure "Mh_SequenceUpdate" line 54)\n    invoked from within     \n"Mh_SequenceUpdate $folder replace $seq $msgids"\n    (procedure "Seq_Set" line 4)\n    invoked from within             \n"Seq_Set $folder cur $msgid"\n    (procedure "Mh_SetCur" line 7)      \n    invoked from within                     \n"Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msgid"\n    (procedure "MsgChange" line 5)              \n    invoked from within                             \n"MsgChange - noshow"\n    invoked from within                                 \n"time [list MsgChange $msgid $show"\n    (procedure "Msg_Change" line 3)\n    invoked from within                                     \n"Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow"\n    (procedure "SelectTypein" line 14)                          \n    invoked from within\n"SelectTypein .mid.right.top.msg -"\n    (command bound to event)\n\nkre\n\nps: I have the sequences window vertical instead of horizontal, and the\n"colours from the ftoc" stuff all deleted, and it is looking just about as\ngood as the old unseen window used to look.   I still have some work to\ndo to make it a little nicer (listboxes seem to have some strange habits)\nand then I need to make it all optional and parameterized, at the minute\nI\'m just embedding stuff in the code, much quicker for prototyping.  Once\nits done, I\'ll send a patch for someone to look over.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers\n\n', 'subject': 'Anolther sequence related traceback'}
