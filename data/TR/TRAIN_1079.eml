I don\'t know about CPU, though.\n\nAlso, the last time I ran KDE 3.5.10 it felt was noticeably lagging\ncompared to my then-current KDE 4.3 setup on the same hardware. Note\nthat the KDE 4.3 even had quite a few other apps installed, and the\nKDE 3.5.10 was a new install that I did to triage a possible\nregression.\n\nLike I said, though, if you need Qt3 libraries in addition to Qt4 (for\nQuanta, for instance) then you will be using the memory of _both_,\nnaturally, and that is a lot!\n\n-- \nDotan Cohen\n\nhttp://bido.com\nhttp://what-is-what.com\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-kde-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
