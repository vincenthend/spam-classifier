I don\'t know about CPU, though.\r\n\r\nAlso, the last time I ran KDE 3.5.10 it felt was noticeably lagging\r\ncompared to my then-current KDE 4.3 setup on the same hardware. Note\r\nthat the KDE 4.3 even had quite a few other apps installed, and the\r\nKDE 3.5.10 was a new install that I did to triage a possible\r\nregression.\r\n\r\nLike I said, though, if you need Qt3 libraries in addition to Qt4 (for\r\nQuanta, for instance) then you will be using the memory of _both_,\r\nnaturally, and that is a lot!\r\n\r\n-- \r\nDotan Cohen\r\n\r\nhttp://bido.com\r\nhttp://what-is-what.com\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-kde-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
