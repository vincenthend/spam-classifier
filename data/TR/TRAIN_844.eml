The workaround is to keep at least one stop link, then\r\nupdate-rc.d will not recreate the symlinks on package upgrades.\r\n\r\nIn squeeze it is possible to run "update-rc.d disable" and "update-rc.d\r\nenable" to disable or enable a service.\r\n\r\nSven\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
