The workaround is to keep at least one stop link, then\nupdate-rc.d will not recreate the symlinks on package upgrades.\n\nIn squeeze it is possible to run "update-rc.d disable" and "update-rc.d\nenable" to disable or enable a service.\n\nSven\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
