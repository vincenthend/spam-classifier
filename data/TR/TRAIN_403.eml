Of\r\ncourse, the xev output he posted came from the mouse leaving the xev\r\nwindow, so maybe you're right and he misunderstood the instructions.\r\n\r\nSo, to make it even clearer: Move the xev window if necessary so it\r\ndoesn't cover the terminal window. Middle click in it, preferably\r\nwithout moving the mouse, even a little. You should now see the mouse\r\nclick event in the terminal window. The moment you move the mouse,\r\ntons of movement events will roll in and scroll the click events right\r\nout of the terminal window.\r\n\r\n- Harald\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
