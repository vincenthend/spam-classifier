All I saw was more of the "myth of the \nliberal media." Every opinion supporting global warming was "the media", \nevery opinion against it was an "expert." A brief perusal of the rest of \nthe web site and I\'m left wondering where the science\nis.\nAnd, to put on my extremist hat, every organization or scientist in \nthere was American. Big deal - a bunch of scientists being trotted out \nto support government and industrial policy that is the ultimate source \nof their livelihood and research money. If the government changes their \nmind on Kyoto, they\'ll trot out another group of tame scientists. And \nall the American papers will switch back to warning us about climate change.\n\nOwen\n\n\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: Just Ask the Experts'}
