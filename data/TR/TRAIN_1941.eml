If you are a user and want to use KDE 3 I \nencourage you to try may package. Please note they are not co-installable \nwith KDE 4 in the moment. If you are a developer please help me with \nbuilding and polishing packages.\n\nIf you want to help out, subscribe to mailinglist xyz.\n\nRegards,\nMike\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, how about that, Mike? How about being the change you want to achieve?\n\nThanks.\n\nNote: KDE 3.5 doesn\'t really need to be co-installable for those only \ninterested in KDE 3.5. At least not initially.\n\nJust a small start might pull this off for you. But if you do not *act*, \nprobably nothing will happen. You can\'t change those who are not \ninterested in providing KDE 3.5 for Debian Squeeze. So either you start \npulling it off for yourself or it - unless someone else feels the \nmotivation to do it - *will just not happen*.\n\nIts as easy as that.\n\nCiao,\n-- \nMartin \'Helios\' Steigerwald - http://www.Lichtvoll.de\nGPG: 03B0 0D6C 0040 0710 4AFA  B82F 991B EAAC A599 84C7\n', 'subject': 'Re: Kde 3.5 ...'}
