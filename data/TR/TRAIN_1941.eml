If you are a user and want to use KDE 3 I=20\r\nencourage you to try may package. Please note they are not co-installable=20\r\nwith KDE 4 in the moment. If you are a developer please help me with=20\r\nbuilding and polishing packages.\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out, subscribe to mailinglist xyz.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nMike\r\n=2D--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNow, how about that, Mike? How about being the change you want to achieve?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nNote: KDE 3.5 doesn\'t really need to be co-installable for those only=20\r\ninterested in KDE 3.5. At least not initially.\r\n\r\nJust a small start might pull this off for you. But if you do not *act*,=20\r\nprobably nothing will happen. You can\'t change those who are not=20\r\ninterested in providing KDE 3.5 for Debian Squeeze. So either you start=20\r\npulling it off for yourself or it - unless someone else feels the=20\r\nmotivation to do it - *will just not happen*.\r\n\r\nIts as easy as that.\r\n\r\nCiao,\r\n=2D-=20\r\nMartin \'Helios\' Steigerwald - http://www.Lichtvoll.de\r\nGPG: 03B0 0D6C 0040 0710 4AFA  B82F 991B EAAC A599 84C7\r\n', 'subject': 'Re: Kde 3.5 ...'}
