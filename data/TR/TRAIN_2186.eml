KDE 4.4 sounds great but it is\r\nnowhere to be found in Debian but in experimental and it sounds like it\r\nis nowhere near ready for production.  3.5.10 is truly and completely,\r\nunusably broken for calendaring other than in a standalone world.\r\n\r\nIt looks like Evolution has introduced webdav support for contacts in\r\n2.24 and we can grab 2.28 from testing.  That sounds better than\r\nexperimental so maybe we need to abandon KMail (sigh) and think about\r\nEvolution instead.
