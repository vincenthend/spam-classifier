Many improvements are rolled into the recent 6.x release.\r\n\r\nIf Debian isn\'t going to keep up with the current trunk; then there\r\nreally is no point in packaging it here. As it stands I\'m not going to\r\ngo backwards a full version, so I have reverted to the PPA builds.\r\n\r\nI don\'t feel that it\'s necessary to package it daily, but\r\nweekly should be done as that\'s the release cycle that Google-Chrome\r\nDeveloper version usually follows.\r\n\r\nFor those of use that also use Debian on a desktop/Laptop BESIDES a\r\nserver; using old versions isn\'t usually desireable on the\r\nworkstations where stability isn\'t as necessary as that of a\r\nproduction server.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
