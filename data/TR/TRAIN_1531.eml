Many improvements are rolled into the recent 6.x release.\n\nIf Debian isn\'t going to keep up with the current trunk; then there\nreally is no point in packaging it here. As it stands I\'m not going to\ngo backwards a full version, so I have reverted to the PPA builds.\n\nI don\'t feel that it\'s necessary to package it daily, but\nweekly should be done as that\'s the release cycle that Google-Chrome\nDeveloper version usually follows.\n\nFor those of use that also use Debian on a desktop/Laptop BESIDES a\nserver; using old versions isn\'t usually desireable on the\nworkstations where stability isn\'t as necessary as that of a\nproduction server.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
