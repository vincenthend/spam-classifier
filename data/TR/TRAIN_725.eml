If not, why?\n\nI\'ve done a dist-upgrade from 7.2 to a quite broken rawhide release... it\nwas a mess, still, it went much faster and smoother than if I had done it\n"manually" with rpm -U or -F. I think that updates between stable releases\nshould still be done with the installer since IIRC, sometimes a few\ntwitches are done by anaconda to migrate configurations to new formats. It\nshould work though... I still prefer backuping config files and\nreinstalling a clean system when I have the time.\n\nMatthias\n\n-- \nMatthias Saou                                World Trade Center\n-------------                                Edificio Norte 4 Planta\nSystem and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, Spain\nElectronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: About apt, kernel updates and dist-upgrade'}
