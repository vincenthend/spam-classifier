If you want to control the interfaces\nmanually, remove NM.  If you want to use NM then only the loopback\ninterface should be defined in /etc/network/interface.  \n\nNM works very well for me on my Ubuntu Lucid laptop.  Meanwhile, my\nDebian desktop utilizes /etc/network/interface as it doesn\'t roam\nanywhere.\n\n- Nate >>\n\n-- \n\n"The optimist proclaims that we live in the best of all\npossible worlds.
