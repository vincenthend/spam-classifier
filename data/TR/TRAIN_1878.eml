If you want to control the interfaces\r\nmanually, remove NM.  If you want to use NM then only the loopback\r\ninterface should be defined in /etc/network/interface.  \r\n\r\nNM works very well for me on my Ubuntu Lucid laptop.  Meanwhile, my\r\nDebian desktop utilizes /etc/network/interface as it doesn\'t roam\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\n- Nate >>\r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\n"The optimist proclaims that we live in the best of all\r\npossible worlds.
