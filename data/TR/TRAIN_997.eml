{'body': 'If I were to install a bare-bones Squeeze system, then add Lenny\r\nrepositories and declare Lenny to be the Default-Release in apt.conf,\r\ncan I expect to have many problems installing a full desktop environment\r\nfrom the Lenny repos?  (Gnome, LXDE, or Fluxbox, most likely).\r\n\r\nReason:\r\n\r\nI use a Debian-Live USB and I like to run Lenny because of the\r\ninfrequent updates.  But one of my laptops requires the Squeeze kernel\r\nin order for wifi to work.  I\'ve been told by the Debian-Live developer\r\nthat I cannot install alternate kernels on my live system (otherwise I\'d\r\nbe able to use a kernel from backports.org).\r\n\r\n-Rob\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
