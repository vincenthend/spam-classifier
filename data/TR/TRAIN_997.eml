{'body': b'If I were to install a bare-bones Squeeze system, then add Lenny\nrepositories and declare Lenny to be the Default-Release in apt.conf,\ncan I expect to have many problems installing a full desktop environment\nfrom the Lenny repos?  (Gnome, LXDE, or Fluxbox, most likely).\n\nReason:\n\nI use a Debian-Live USB and I like to run Lenny because of the\ninfrequent updates.  But one of my laptops requires the Squeeze kernel\nin order for wifi to work.  I\'ve been told by the Debian-Live developer\nthat I cannot install alternate kernels on my live system (otherwise I\'d\nbe able to use a kernel from backports.org).\n\n-Rob\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
