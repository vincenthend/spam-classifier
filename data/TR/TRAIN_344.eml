I did not assert that you "can\'t track\nspammers".  Here is what I said:\n\n| It will be difficult to find, prosecute, and win money from someone in\n| various non-friendly countries where spam originates (China is a good\n| example) even if they do officially "respect" copyright law.\n\nI understand the incentive that you have to pursue spammers, but that\ndoes not directly translate to less spam being sent to my inbox.  It is\nan indirect effect and the magnitude of the effect may not be sufficient\nto counteract the ease with which a -20 score on the mark allows spam to\navoid being tagged as spam.\n\n> Daniel, it\'s easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself\n> on your installation.

I\'m just not comfortable with using SpamAssassin as a vehicle\nfor drumming up your business at the expense of our user base.\n\nI think it would make more sense to start Habeas with a less aggressive\nscore (one which will not give spammers a quick path into everyone\'s\ninbox) and after we\'ve seen evidence that the system works, then we can\nincrease the magnitude of the score.\n\nDan\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nSpamassassin-talk mailing list\nSpamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: [SAtalk] O.T.
