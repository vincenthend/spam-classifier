I will have to look into it again, \nbut I have 3 drives so they could not all be in the two yellow ports. \nThis may also explain why fdisk lists my drives in the order: sdc, sdb, \nsda. Running lspci -k, I don\'t recall seeing ata_piix at all.\n\nThanks for the input, I will have another look tonight.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
