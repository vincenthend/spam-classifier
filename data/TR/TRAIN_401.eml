I will have to look into it again, \r\nbut I have 3 drives so they could not all be in the two yellow ports. \r\nThis may also explain why fdisk lists my drives in the order: sdc, sdb, \r\nsda. Running lspci -k, I don\'t recall seeing ata_piix at all.\r\n\r\nThanks for the input, I will have another look tonight.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
