But then the relation between two \nparts stops there. As I don\'t know what are all of your specific \nsituation details, I\'m also unaware if this kind of agreement is out of \nplace or just fits well within your environment.\n\n> That is some part of the problem.

That is the only way to protect \n(free) the code.\n\n>> You can enforce a PDF to use DRM *and* activation measures.

Only proprietary tools \n(Adobe Reader?) enforce the use of the kind of policies you are looking \nfor.\n\nInside open source world is a bit difficult to find programs or tools \nthat make what you are looking for, that is, preventing users to make \ntheir own :-)\n\nGreetings,\n\n-- \nCamalen\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
