No \r\nagreement, no contract.\r\n\r\n> More\r\n> generally, how can you prove that if they did not sign, it is because of\r\n> their personal opinion? \r\n\r\nAll of us hold our "personal opinions" and nobody can force any user to \r\nsign any contrat they don\'t agree. But then the relation between two \r\nparts stops there. As I don\'t know what are all of your specific \r\nsituation details, I\'m also unaware if this kind of agreement is out of \r\nplace or just fits well within your environment.\r\n\r\n> That is some part of the problem.

That is the only way to protect \r\n(free) the code.\r\n\r\n>> You can enforce a PDF to use DRM *and* activation measures.
