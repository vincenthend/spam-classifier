{'body': 'Hello People,\n\nI am new to SA but (2) problems I do have.\n\nI run SA from my own home for personal use and it seems to work but I see this\nin my procmail log:\n\n\n<cut>\nprocmail: Executing " ~/bin/SpamAssassin/spamassassin -P -c ~/bin/SpamAssassin/rules"\ndccproc: not found\ndccproc: not found\n<cut>\n\nCan someone enlighten me on why I get that? FreeBSD 4.6-STABLE, SA-2.3.0\n\n\n\nSecondly, I\'ve tested (now on Three boxes) SA for site-wide usage but I believe I am\nmissing something major because I\'ve also had my setting checked/verified.\n\nThe problem is that the site-wide setup does NOT seem to work. Why?\n\n1. I have my local.cf in /etc/mail/spamassassin\n2. I have spamd running, and mail delivery logs show that all e-mails are\n   being passed thro SA.\n\nMy local.cf contains:\n\nENABLED=1\nOPTIONS="-F 0"\n\n#\nrewrite_subject         0\nreport_header           1  \ndefang_mime             0\nrequired_hits           7.0\nreport_header           1\nuse_terse_report        1\nsubject_tag             **SPAM**\n\n\n\nwash (\'tty\') ~ 337 -> exim -bt engingwarez@runjiri.co.ke\neng.ngware@runji.co.ke\n  deliver to enginngware in domain runjiri.co.ke\n  director = spamcheck_director, transport = spamcheck\n\n\nHowever when I check the mail delivered to this mailbox, SA has _not_ added any headers\nto it.\n\nPERTINENT: I also run a Virus Scanner called DRWEB via Exim\'s system filter and the rules\nthat I have applied are:\n\nif not first_delivery or\n    $received_protocol is "drweb-scanned" or\n    $received_protocol is "spam-scanned"\nthen\n  finish\nendif\n\n\nSome enlightenment would bail me out, I believe.\n\nThanks\n\n\n\n-Wash\n\n-- \nOdhiambo Washington  <wash@wananchi.com>    "The box said \'Requires\nWananchi Online Ltd.  www.wananchi.com      Windows 95, NT, or better,\'\nTel: 254 2 313985-9   Fax: 254 2 313922     so I installed FreeBSD."   \nGSM: 254 72 743 223   GSM: 254 733 744 121  This sig is McQ!  :-)\n\n\n"We demand rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty!"\n\t\t-- Vroomfondel\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nSpamassassin-talk mailing list\nSpamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk\n\n\n', 'subject': '[SAtalk] Personal/Site-Wide SA Glitch (Spamassassin+Exim)'}
