I asked about it\nonce, and got <shrug> back.\n\nOtherwise, I'm a happy KDE4.4 user (on a number of distros).\n\nAny chance?\n\n-- \nTrish Fraser, JD9R RQ2D\n52.4161N,16.9303E\ndo mei  6 19:16:30 CEST 2010\nGNU/Linux 1997-2010 #283226 counter.li.org\nandromeda up 1 hour(s), 3 min.\nkernel 2.6.31.13-desktop-1mnb\n--\n", 'subject': 'Re: Kde 3.5 ...'}
