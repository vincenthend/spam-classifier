I asked about it\r\nonce, and got <shrug> back.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I'm a happy KDE4.4 user (on a number of distros).\r\n\r\nAny chance?\r\n\r\n--=20\r\nTrish Fraser, JD9R RQ2D\r\n52.4161N,16.9303E\r\ndo mei  6 19:16:30 CEST 2010\r\nGNU/Linux 1997-2010 #283226 counter.li.org\r\nandromeda up 1 hour(s), 3 min.\r\nkernel 2.6.31.13-desktop-1mnb\r\n--\r\n", 'subject': 'Re: Kde 3.5 ...'}
