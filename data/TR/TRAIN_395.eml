But there\'s at least two main \'opposing thumbs\' between regedit and gconf:\n\n    1. GConf is written in English, not symbol tables; you can actually READ what the heck you\'re looking at.\n\n    2. Because it\'s better-considered, it should be more sound; when the registry gets a wrong value, you may not be able to boot....if GConf is scrogged, you can still have all the underlying power of the OS to keep things running....just call up WindowMaker (or whatever) for the next session until you get it worked out.\n\n    It took me a while to warm up to it...but I *do* like Gconf...\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Fahrl\xe4nder              Linux Zealot, Conservative, and Technomad\nEvansville, IN                    My Voyage: http://www.CounterMoon.com\nICQ  5119262\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"Waddling" into the mainstream?
