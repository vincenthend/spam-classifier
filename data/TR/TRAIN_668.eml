{'body': "Two interesting analyses of the Irish implementation of copyright as led by, as\nbest I can tell, anticipation of the EUCD (since the Irish law was passed in\n2000, and the EUCD is somewhat more recent than that). The pieces of interest\nare the papers by Prof. Robert Clark, who perhaps might not be a bad choice of\nspeaker for some future LUG gathering. One of the more eye-opening comments in\nthe second of his papers is that Irish legislation is, in effect, more\ndraconian than the DMCA.\n\nhttp://www.cai.ie/Past%20Events.html#2002\n\nThere are some other interesting pieces here, too, for anyone concerned about\ncopyright and the like in Ireland.\n\nCheers,\nWaider.
