"Developers are now free to implement what is documented in the\nspecifications without restrictions from Adobe."\n\nI think you might separate the description of file format (free) and\nthe code itself (proprietary). So you can write your flash player\nusing the documentation but you cannot get the code of Adobe Flash\nPlayer.\n\n>>> Sorry, but I do cannot fully trust Adobe nor any company behind a\n>>> product with such "terse" license model...\n>>\n>> No one is holding your feet to the fire while simultaneously\n>> waterboarding you, saying "Trust Adobe!!"\n>\n> Oh, no, but...

I\nthink the answer is no... Do you have trust in them?\n\nBye,\na\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe". Trouble?
