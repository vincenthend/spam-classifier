I tend to feel that if we\nhave extremely good compilation tools, then those tools should be able\nto do the inlining and optimisation far better than I could. That\'s the\ntheory anyway :) And there\'s always a tradeoff with inlining between\nspeed and memory bloat (which may sometimes be no tradeoff if swap\nstarts getting involved...)\n\nGary.\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users\' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: [ILUG] slashdot EW Dijkstra humor'}
