{'body': "Hi,\n\nI noticed on many computers with Debian, whatever the kernel (2.6.xx, xx\n>= 26), that, once ``too much'' tabs have been opened, Firefox/Iceweasel\nbecomes sluggish, slower and slower, and often stalls after some time. I\nalso noticed that, when becoming more and more sluggish, it takes more\nand more RAM, even when all the pages are completely loaded. Why? Am I\nthe only person who's experiencing this? Is there an objective\nexplanation to this?\n\n-- \nMerciadri Luca\nSee http://www.student.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/~merciadri/\nI use PGP.
