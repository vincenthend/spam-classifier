I\r\nalso noticed that, when becoming more and more sluggish, it takes more\r\nand more RAM, even when all the pages are completely loaded. Why? Am I\r\nthe only person who's experiencing this? Is there an objective\r\nexplanation to this?\r\n\r\n--=20\r\nMerciadri Luca\r\nSee http://www.student.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/~merciadri/\r\nI use PGP.
