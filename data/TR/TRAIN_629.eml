Then, run "startx" and check for the output.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your reply Camale\xf3n.\r\n\r\nI booted up and got the login GUI screen.  Then used the choice of\r\nconsole login, and using my usual user name, logged in with the CLI.\r\nThen run "startx" ... and lo and behold get my KDE4 main screen!\r\n\r\nSo I conclude that the problem lies with the GUI KDE login.\r\n\r\nAlthough some might be interested in figuring out exactly the problem, I\r\ntake on the role of a "user" here and wish to figure out how to make my\r\nsystem well again.  (Of course, anyone reading this who wants to delve\r\ninto why this is happening, I\'d assist.)\r\n\r\nIf you, or anyone else, could tell me what I can try to do to fix\r\nthings, I\'d appreciate it.  I know I can do a clean install of\r\neverything, but I would be hopeful that less drastic things might work.\r\n  Any chance of fixing things by doing a reinstall or particular\r\npackages?  If so, not only telling me which packages to try, but also a\r\nlittle guidance with exactly *how* to do it would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nAt least at this point, I can get back to most of my old system programs\r\nand data, so the urgency is abated.\r\n\r\nI want to throw one other thing in here, just in case it rings a bell or\r\nsomeone sees some relationship to this password/login problem.  I\r\nmentioned in my original post that I had other problems.  Back in March,\r\njust before my emergency 1-week residence in a hospital, I suddenly\r\nstarting having problems with certain programs I regularly use (date was\r\nprobably around March 14).  The programs I believe all use GTK.  Some\r\nare: iceape, synaptic, geany.  And here are the results when I try\r\nrunning them from the command line:\r\n\r\ndon@kali:~$ sudo synaptic\r\nsynaptic: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libgdk-x11-2.0.so.0: undefined\r\nsymbol: g_malloc_n\r\ndon@kali:~$ iceape\r\n/usr/lib/iceape/iceape-bin: symbol lookup error:\r\n/usr/lib/libgdk-x11-2.0.so.0: undefined symbol: g_malloc_n\r\ndon@kali:~$ geany\r\ngeany: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libgdk-x11-2.0.so.0: undefined\r\nsymbol: g_malloc_n\r\ndon@kali:~$\r\n\r\nUnless there is some relation to my password/login problem of this\r\nthread, I\'ll start a new thread with the above problem.\r\n\r\nThanks, and if anyone has more ideas on fixing my password/login\r\nproblem, please help!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDon\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
