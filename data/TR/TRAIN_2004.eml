Problematic?\n\nDifficult to judge, since I somehow lost track of what exactly you tried\nto achieve and what is the nature of the document.\n\nIf you are simply afraid, that someone would use this document as\nher/his own work you could watermark the pdf and convert it to a low\nresolution bitmap (as others have already suggested). If the document\nwas later misused, you could just show your nice, high quality printout\nwithout watermarks to prove that you are the real author.\n\nAnother way might be to hand out that bad quality printout on some\nspecial paper, either coloured or with rules and keep the pdf version to\nyourself. It will be about as difficult to retype/recreate such a\ndocument from paper as from retyping it from screen, which was your\nfirst choice (disallow printing, allow screen viewing).\n\nI think you might have gotten better replies in shorter time, if you had\nbeen more explicit and clear about what you try to achieve.\n\n- --\nJohannes\n\nIn questions of science, the authority of a thousand is not worth the\nhumble reasoning of a single individual.\n- - Galileo Galilei, physicist and astronomer (1564-1642)\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.9 (GNU/Linux)\n\niEYEARECAAYFAkvOssIACgkQC1NzPRl9qEVFsgCfVRlKyYWkvwPViEKl1j1mWOVj\n7GUAn2knZWl/41ciugK7HRDfXVmKgI62\n=18lF\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
