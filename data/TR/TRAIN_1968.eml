The spam \noften appears to originate there because it\'s coming from open \nhttp, or squid proxy servers.  It\'s hosted there because these \nspammers are now persona-non-grata on all US ISPs.  One hardly \nneeds to involve the Chinese government in a case where a US \ncitizen is violating US law.\n\n\n>  - Law suits take time.

These \ninclude many legal precedents which are used to protect the \nrights of ISPs to block mail, and to terminate service to \nspammers.\n\n>  - Contact information can change: phone numbers, PO boxes, stolen\n>    cell phones, temporary email addresses, etc.\n\nSurprising then, how much information you can find on the \ncurrent whereabouts of long-time spammers like Alan Ralksy of \nDetroit, Michigan.  Ralsky is a guy who even gives interviews to \nthe news media.  If you can connect a specific corpus of spam to \nhim, his street address is well known. Ralsky is a prime \ncandidate for lawsuits in any state with an anti-spam law. \nThomas Cowles is another long-time spammer, but last I heard \nhe\'d been jailed for stealing computer equipment from his \nbusiness partner, Eddy Marin (also a long time spammer (You\'ve \nheard of PopLaunch, right?)\n\n>  - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information!

Seems she had an open \nfile-share on her laptop, and when she forged the wrong domain, \nthe real owner hacked in and posted all her private information \non a website. Oh, look, it\'s still there, including the nude \nphotos:\n\nhttp://belps.freewebsites.com/\n\nI recall this well, because the SEC was VERY interested in \nconfirming the validity of the information found online.  There \nwere some "interesting" conversations. This summer, the SEC \nreleased the following:\n\nhttp://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/33-8113.htm\n\nYes, the investigation took two years, but the financial penalty \nfor operating a pump-and-dump scam isn\'t small.  The wheels of \ngovernment grind slow, but the grind very fine indeed.\n\n--B\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: Jabber - The world\'s fastest growing \nreal-time communications platform!
