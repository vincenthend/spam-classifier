But going on that very\nbroad assumption, I guess I\'m describing\nthe flip side of Mr. Roger\'s experience:\nthe paisanos (who leave behind those who\nremain on a patron\'s rural land) move to\nManila, and (the second assumption) squat\nin shantytowns there, at least until they\ncan line up a middle-class job.\n\nSo, going on two large assumptions, I can\ncome up with a scenario under which title\nwould take 20 years: a shantytown arises\nsomewhere in the midst of a section (or\nwhatever the Spanish used to divvy up the\nland) and it takes decades of arguing to\nput together a package which somehow can\nboth compensate the owner and record lots\nfor the inhabitants.  Just transferring\ntitle to an existing lot, between parties\nwho have money, ought not to be a problem.\n\nThe obvious solution, at least to us\nbarking farting chihuahuas on FoRK, is\nto "introduce market mechanisms".  It is\nleft as an exercise to come up with one\nwhich works when many of the agents (are\nperceived to) have negligible NPV.\n\n-Dave\n\n>              [land reform] meant that all the agricultural producers had\n> to plant crops all the time (profitable or not) ...\n\nWhat happened to more highly-capitalized\nland?

Any chance of\nan explanation of that "Bell Jar" in\nthe meantime?\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n', 'subject': "RE: The Curse of India's Socialism"}
