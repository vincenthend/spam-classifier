{'body': b'-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\nHash: SHA1\n\nOn Thursday 06 May 2010, Mike Bird was heard to say:\n> Debian is the sole remaining major\n> distro that cared enough for its users to ship KDE 3.5.\n\nWhen Lenny was released, KDE4 was just plain broken. Since then, it \nhas matured such that other distributions which have released with \nit.\n\nI do not believe the decision to stay with KDE3 in Lenny was anything \nother than the simple pragmatic fact that Lenny was being released at \nthat time.\n\n> I guess this discussion is about trying to figure\n> out what KDE end users can do when Debian pulls the plug on us.\n\nAs much as I prefer KDE3, I agree that there is nothing else the \nDebian developers can do, since to take up KDE3 would require \neffectively duplicating the entire KDE development team.\n\nThe dropping of KDE3 is a simple fact of life because it is no longer \nmaintained upstream. I hope the pain will be worth it in the long \nrun.\n\nWhat I do not appreciate is that the attitude has been not "we have to \ndo this", but "we\'re doing it, must suck to be you."\n\nCurt-\n\n\n- -- \nThose who torment us for our own good will torment us without end,\nfor they do so with the approval of their consciences.\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.9 (GNU/Linux)\n\niQEVAwUBS+Nb3S9Y35yItIgBAQLhGQf/Xf1HbACgc/BXPDJv2YrsJ/pOo+b6w/GJ\nZPvBoJX6Zlmr98zeCPhPdzLbRMYKfFMsbxHRfSF43x/B3PVqXegErFVdbKcVqH+/\nlxRczYaXDbcYHcGdS6Ntmw2ZbSxRA4xnnGeW5feqPOAZI73KTU7THQ0KoCz4fepi\na7y3H/SSgxUWXMwLEQ4ij8IvKKG4aJnW460J11vcesXuEH9xYf1knkzxpQuc0fzU\n2UYsJBQvrrHxO+bE1DeSNkdtUxjtwtSkXRex8JUyEs38y1IKRXmoPs2WhXrYZTWo\nvoTPSGs3XpzgCxY1I4snVfFwA4rtk42V5xenuggFd9Yh8oGhjJl4+Q==\n=8pV7\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-kde-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
