If you see that once, feed it into \nyour bayesian classifier, and it classifies the URLs used for the \nimages. Then next time it sees one, it knows with almost 100% accuracy \nthat an email with one of those URLs is definitely spam.\n\nIn many ways this is like Razor, which is why I'm hacking on a \ndistributed system to do this, to see if it's feasible to scale it globally.\n\nMatt.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old\ncell phone?
