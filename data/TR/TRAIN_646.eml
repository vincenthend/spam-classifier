{'body': "Hi folks,\r\n\r\nI *think* this happened after upgrading to 10.6.3, but I also recall\r\nthere was a security patch, I apologize because I was sort of\r\nabsentmindedly updating myself which I hadn't done in a while.  So...er,\r\nnot exactly sure what the cause is.  But, the issue is this:\r\n\r\nWhen I'm using X11/XQuartz (I've just tried the default xterm as well as\r\nrxvt I installed via macports), what seems to happen is that I can open\r\na terminal and use it for a little while, but if I leave x11, that is if\r\nit looses focus, and then I come back, I can no longer switch between\r\nwindows, enter anything with the keyboard, click and select windows with\r\nmy mouse, etc.  All input to x11 seems to be dead.  I have to kill it\r\nand then restart it again to get it to work at all, and then the same\r\nthing happens.  I've tried reinstalling it but that hasn't helped.\r\n\r\nDoes this behavior ring a bell to anyone?  Any help would be greatly\r\nappreciated, I live in rxvt and don't like using Terminal.app very much!\r\n\r\nThanks--\r\n\r\nDave\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
