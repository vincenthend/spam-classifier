{'body': 'Hello,\n\nKDE SC 4.4.2 packages in qt-kde.debian.net have been superseded by packages \nuploaded to official Debian experimental archive and therefore they were \nremoved from the semi-official repository. As it was written on the \nintroductory page of qt-kde.debian.net, the repository itself will remain to \nexist and might get some random extremely bleeding edge updates from time to \ntime. Feel free to keep it in your /etc/apt/sources.list.\n\n-- \nModestas Vainius <modestas@vainius.eu>\n', 'subject': 'EOL of KDE SC 4.4.2 in qt-kde.debian.net'}
