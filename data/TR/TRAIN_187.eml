You don\'t have to.  Short\nof Palladium, you can do whatever you want with bytes you hold, including\nreading messages and erasing the traces.  I\'ll buy a chocolate sundae for\nanyone who can show otherwise.\n\nAn attacker might be able to verify that you *have* read a message (e.g.  \nby seeing that you saved and edited a copy) but not that you *haven\'t*.  \nIf your email client was compromised you could put a packet sniffer on the\nline before downloading mail.  If an attacker installed a packet sniffer\nsniffer, you could run it in a spoofing VM.\n\nThe only exception to the rule that your machine belongs to you is --\nmaybe -- Palladium.\n\n- Lucas\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: The case for spam'}
