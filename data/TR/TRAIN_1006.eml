I am also concerned that it was added after\nthe rules freeze, that such a major change was not discussed in advance,\netc.\n\nThere\'s also no evidence that the rule will actually reduce FPs.  People\nwho are smart enough to use the rule are probably capable of writing\nemail that doesn\'t look like spam (I\'m not counting spam mailing lists\nwhich you need to be exempted from spam filtering).\n\nDan\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: Jabber - The world\'s fastest growing \nreal-time communications platform!
