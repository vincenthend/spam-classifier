{'body': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/23/opinion/23HERB.html?todaysheadlines=&pagewanted=print&position=top\n\n The New York Times\nSeptember 23, 2002\nHigh-Altitude Rambos\nBy BOB HERBERT\n\nDr. Bob Rajcoomar, a U.S. citizen and former military physician from Lake\nWorth, Fla., found himself handcuffed and taken into custody last month in\none of the many episodes of hysteria to erupt on board airliners in the\nU.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nDr. Rajcoomar was seated in first class on a Delta Airlines flight from\nAtlanta to Philadelphia on Aug. 31 when a passenger in the coach section\nbegan behaving erratically. The passenger, Steven Feuer, had nothing to do\nwith Dr. Rajcoomar.\n\nTwo U.S. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back\nto coach to confront Mr. Feuer, who was described by witnesses as a slight\nman who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying. When Mr. Feuer\nrefused to remain in his seat, the marshals reacted as if they were trying\nout for the lead roles in Hollywood\'s latest action extravaganza.\n\nThey handcuffed Mr. Feuer, hustled him into first class and restrained him\nin a seat next to Dr. Rajcoomar. The 180 or so passengers were now quite\njittery. Dr. Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flight\nattendant obliged, finding him another seat in first class. The incident,\nalready scary, could - and should - have ended there. But the marshals were\nnot ready to let things quiet down.\n\nOne of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. The\nmarshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats, and\nremain still. They barked a series of orders. No one should stand for any\nreason. Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. No one should try\nto visit the restroom. The message could not have been clearer: anyone who\ndisobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot.\n\nThe passengers were petrified, with most believing that there were\nterrorists on the plane.\n\n"I was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurized\ncabin," said Senior Judge James A. Lineberger of the Philadelphia Court of\nCommon Pleas, a veteran of 20 years in the military, who was sitting in an\naisle seat in coach. "I was afraid that I was going to die from the gunfire\nin a shootout."\n\nDr. Rajcoomar\'s wife, Dorothy, who was seated quite a distance from her\nhusband, said, "It was really like Rambo in the air." She worried that\nthere might be people on the plane who did not speak English, and therefore\ndid not understand the marshals\' orders. If someone got up to go to the\nbathroom, he or she might be shot.\n\nThere were no terrorists on board. There was no threat of any kind. When\nthe plane landed about half an hour later, Mr. Feuer was taken into\ncustody. And then, shockingly, so was Dr. Rajcoomar. The air marshals\ngrabbed the doctor from behind, handcuffed him and, for no good reason that\nanyone has been able to give, hauled him to an airport police station where\nhe was thrown into a filthy cell.\n\nThis was airline security gone berserk. No one ever suggested that Dr.\nRajcoomar, a straight-arrow retired Army major, had done anything wrong.\n\nDr. Rajcoomar, who is of Indian descent, said he believes he was taken into\ncustody solely because of his brown skin. He was held for three frightening\nhours and then released without being charged. Mr. Feuer was also released.\n\nOfficials tried to conceal the names of the marshals, but they were\neventually identified by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter as Shawn B.\nMcCullers and Samuel Mumma of the Transportation Security Administration,\nwhich is part of the U.S. Transportation Department.\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the\nincident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr.\nRajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident "too\nclosely."\n\nIf that becomes a criterion for arrest in the U.S., a lot of us reporters\nare headed for jail.\n\nDr. Rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode. "I\nhad never been treated like that in my life," he said. "I was afraid that I\nwas about to be beaten up or killed."\n\nLawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union have taken up his case and\nhe has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawful\ndetention.\n\n"We have to take a look at what we\'re doing in the name of security," said\nDr. Rajcoomar. "So many men and women have fought and died for freedom in\nthis great country, and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name of\nsecurity."\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR. A.
