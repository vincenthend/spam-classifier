Thus each line starting with debian binds a different value\nto the name debian. Only one can apply. They cannot all apply at once.\n\nIf, instead, you change them to\n\n \tdebian http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/\n \tdebia2 http://debian.cs.binghamton.edu/debian/\n \tdebia3 http://debian.lcs.mit.edu/debian/\n\nPut into your sources.list three lines where you now have only one\npointing to debian in you approx proxy server, the other two point to\ndebia2 and debia3, also in you proxy server. You probably will get\nsomething close to what you want. Apt-get or aptitude will work its\nway down sources.list until it finds a working server and update the\ncorresponding section of the proxy cache.\n\nBut this would make approx create three separate proxy caches, one for\neach external repository. I think that this is not really what you want.\n\nI suggest that you look at \n/var/cache/approx/\nYou will find one one subdirectory there for each definition\nline in your /etc/approx.conf file. You might get what you\nwant by replacing directories debia2 and debia3 by symlinks\nthat point to debian.\n\nPost a reply saying whether this works. I don\'t have a situation where\nI can test this exactly, and I\'d like to know.\n\nHTH\n\n> \n> before the one for ftp.us.d.o and have those be used by preference\n> unless our link to I2 is down, in which case have it switch over to\n> the more generic ftp.us .\n> \n> Is this possible now?
