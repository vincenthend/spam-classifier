The idea\r\nwas to sooth computerphobic office workers by making their screens look\r\njust like their desktops.  That\'s the origin of the "desktop metaphor".\r\nFortunately, they did not decide to label disk drives "drawers".\r\n\r\n> Who remembers dialing?\r\n\r\nI do, of course.  I even have several working 500Ds somewhere in the\r\njunk box.\r\n\r\n> Where did that word come from? ;-)\r\n\r\nWikipedia says "The word dialling originally referred to the creation of\r\nthe mathematics required to create a sundial face to tell time based on\r\nthe position of the sun. Those skilled in the art were referred to as\r\ndialists or gnomonists; taken from the word gnomon (a device using a\r\nshadow as an indicator)."\r\n-- \r\nJohn Hasler\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
