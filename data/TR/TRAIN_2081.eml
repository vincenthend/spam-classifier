{'body': "Hi all,\nI've run into a fairly intractable (for me) problem, and was wondering\nif anybody could give me pointers on how to deal with it.\n\nI am running Debian Woody on a Pentium III IDE based system.\nI have a Ricoh 7083a ide cd rewriter, which I use using cdrecord and the\nscsi over ide kernel modules.  I was running kernel 2.4.18 until\nprobably last weekend when I noticed 2.4.19 was out.  Downloaded patch\nand installed new kernel with no real problems.  This morning I went to\nburn a CDROM, and the system locked hard.  Rebooting into 2.4.18 allowed\ncdburning to work fine.\n\nThis problem is very reproducible (on my system at least).\nthe cdrecord command I was using was\n    cdrecord -v speed=4 blank=fast dev=0,1,0 -data bak.iso\nThe blanking appears to go ok, but when it tries to write data, it just\nlocks up the entire system (can't ping it from outside even).  AFAICS,\nthe system just stops.  Hard reset is only way back in, and when it does\nreboot, I cannot see anything useful in any logfiles (/var/log/messages\n/var/log/kern.log /var/log/syslog, at any rate).\ncdrecord -scanbus works fine and reports the two pseudo-scsi devices (my\ncdr drive and my cdrw).\nThe same lock occurs even if there is no blanking.\n\nI tried upgrading to 2.4.20-pre1-ac1 (on assumption that if there was a\nkernel issue it might have been fixed in these patches), but it gives\nthe same error.  I also downloaded and compiled the source for\ncdrecord 1.1.10, and installed it instead of the debian package (i was\nwondering if maybe there was some compile option the packager had used\nwhich maybe would cause the problem), and still the problem persisted.\n\nAnyway, I'm completely stumped.  Google searching has not done me much\ngood, and I'm a little bit lost.  What I'd like to know is\na)  How to fix the problem ;-)\nb)  Is this likely to be an application or kernel problem?  The severity\n    of the crash would make me suspect it is a kernel problem, but I'm\n    not very knowledgeable on these things.\nc)  Should I post a description of this to the kernel mailing list? If\n    this is an appropriate course of action, are there any tips (beyond\n    the guidelines on kernel.org)?\n\nLike I said, I'm lost on this one, so any info is very gratefully\nreceived.\nmick\n-- \nMichael Conry   Ph.:+353-1-7161987, Web: http://www.acronymchile.com\nKey fingerprint = 5508 B563 6791 5C84 A947  CB01 997B 3598 09DE 502C\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n", 'subject': '[ILUG] cdrecord + 2.4.19 = hard-lock'}
