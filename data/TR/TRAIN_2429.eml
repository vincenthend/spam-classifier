{'body': 'From nobody Fri Sep  7 01:04:46 2018\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\n\nHi!\r\n\r\nI=92m having strange display problems with several web browsers. Certain\r\nlayout parts (as borders or backgrounds) aren=92t at the appropriate\r\nplace; and they=92re moving if I hover them. I encountered this problem\r\nwith the following browsers:\r\n\r\n - iceweasel from lenny-backports\r\n - firefox downloaded directly from Mozilla\r\n - epiphany from lenny-backports\r\n\r\nThis behaviour already occured before installing firefox; and it=92s not\r\ncaused by any plug-ins or add-ons as epiphany (which I didn=92t customize=\r\n)\r\nbehaves the same (wrong) way.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the problem, I made a screenshot of e. g. German Bash\r\nBlog: web page [1], screenshot [2]. On other pages, there are similar\r\nerrors.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if anyone could tell me how to fix this or where to\r\nask for further help.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nRobin\r\n\r\n[1] http://german-blog.org/\r\n[2] http://rkrahl.de/gbo.png\r\n\r\n--=20\r\nRobin Krahl\r\nrobin@rkrahl.de\r\nhttp://rkrahl.de\r\n\r\n', 'subject': 'Display Problems with several Web Browsers'}
