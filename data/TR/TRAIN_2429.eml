{'body': 'Hi!\n\nI’m having strange display problems with several web browsers. Certain\nlayout parts (as borders or backgrounds) aren’t at the appropriate\nplace; and they’re moving if I hover them. I encountered this problem\nwith the following browsers:\n\n - iceweasel from lenny-backports\n - firefox downloaded directly from Mozilla\n - epiphany from lenny-backports\n\nThis behaviour already occured before installing firefox; and it’s not\ncaused by any plug-ins or add-ons as epiphany (which I didn’t customize)\nbehaves the same (wrong) way.\n\nTo illustrate the problem, I made a screenshot of e. g. German Bash\nBlog: web page [1], screenshot [2]. On other pages, there are similar\nerrors.\n\nIt would be great if anyone could tell me how to fix this or where to\nask for further help.\n\nBest regards,\nRobin\n\n[1] http://german-blog.org/\n[2] http://rkrahl.de/gbo.png\n\n-- \nRobin Krahl\nrobin@rkrahl.de\nhttp://rkrahl.de\n\n', 'subject': 'Display Problems with several Web Browsers'}
