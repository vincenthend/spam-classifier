To install\r\nonly certain cherry-picked applications from Sid, you have to use\r\napt pinning.  And don\'t use synaptic.  (But since you don\'t have X\r\nrunning, you can\'t use synaptic.  Yet.  But once you get it running,\r\ndon\'t use synaptic.  I\'ve heard that it does not respect apt pinning.)\r\n\r\n-- \r\n  .\'\'`.
