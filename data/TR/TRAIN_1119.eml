We have been following t=\r\nhe cosmetics and beauty industry now for quite some time. According to Fo=\r\nrbes.com who did an article on the growth of the cosmetics industry, beau=\r\nty products generate nearly 230 billion annually in global sales, with a =\r\nconsumer preference placed on products that are high tech and natural bas=\r\ned (favoring companies like EUOK). With the current status of the company=\r\n, EUOK is poised to grab no less than 1% of global sales, ensuring 230 mi=\r\nllion in gross sales for EUOK. Based off revenue alone that would warrant=\r\n a $6.57 share price.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The financials speak for themselves; EUOK is set to make a run and is e=\r\nxtremely undervalued.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the past, large multinational corporations have dominated the market=\r\n place, but in recent years boutique brands such as EUOK have been at the=\r\n fore front of consumer spending. EUOK is ready to take full advantage of=\r\n this. Data released from the NPD Group (a marketing info company based i=\r\nn New York) says luxury cosmetics have grown at an annual rate of 4% - 7%=\r\n since 2002. Estee lauder and L=E2=80=99Oreal have realized this and have=\r\n been acquiring companies like EUOK in order to meet the demand of consum=\r\ners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  There are several reasons behind the growth in high-end cosmetics: the =\r\nexpansion of new markets in Russia and Asia; changing social norms that m=\r\nake using cosmetics--not to mention undergoing cosmetic surgery--more acc=\r\neptable; celebrity worship; promotion within fashion magazines; improveme=\r\nnts in the technology that creates makeup; the influence of mass retailer=\r\ns that can offer lower prices, and raising affluence. As cosmetics become=\r\ns less expensive, better and more accessible, more affluent women--and in=\r\ncreasingly men as well--have moved away from older brands of makeup and s=\r\nkincare in search of higher-quality new products and more exclusivity. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  EUOK recognizes this and has gained retail distribution worldwide throu=\r\ngh its relationships with department store retail giants such as Barneys =\r\nNew York, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus, Bliss, Harr=\r\nods (London), Printemps (France), La Rinascente (Italy) and Lane Crawford=\r\n (Hong Kong).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Upper management of EUOK has a three prong approach to further drive gl=\r\nobal brand recognition:\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  North America \r\n\r\n  EUOK strategy in North America is one of strong luxury brand positionin=\r\ng through partnerships with premier department stores and flagship locati=\r\nons. EUOK department store partners include Bergdorf Goodman in New York =\r\nCity, Barneys New York nationwide, Ogilvy, as well as boutique-style depa=\r\nrtment stores across USA and Canada. EUOK also operates brand-owned flags=\r\nhip stores in Toronto and Vancouver. EUOK subsidiary, Hewitt-Vevey, is po=\r\nsitioned in medical facilities and online, with p\r\nlans to grow in both directions. Future expansion plans include creating =\r\nnew partnerships with other major department stores, as well as positioni=\r\nng with 5-star hotels in key markets. \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n  Europe \r\n\r\n  EUOK distribution in Europe varies by market but is restricted to luxur=\r\ny channels that position the brand amongst the leading luxury skincare br=\r\nands. Our representation includes department stores and perfumeries in ma=\r\njor markets. These channels include Printemps in France, Harrods and Libe=\r\nrty in the UK, La Rinascente in Italy, as well as perfumeries in other co=\r\nuntries. Expansion plans for Europe are focused primarily in the UK and F=\r\nrance with negotiations with premier department stores under way. \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Asia \r\n\r\n  EUOK distribution in Asia varies by country for best positioning amongs=\r\nt the leading luxury brands. Our major department store partner in Hong K=\r\nong is Lane Crawford, as well as Joyce. We are also represented through l=\r\nuxury perfumeries and spas in Singapore and South Eastern China. Asia rep=\r\nresents our largest immediate growth potential. We are in communication w=\r\nith major department stores and distributors in Japan, South Korea, Taiwa=\r\nn and other major markets in China. We expect new accounts for EUOK, as w=\r\nell as major interest in WhiteRX, an upcoming product of our subsidiary, =\r\nHewitt-Vevey, to drive significant growth in Asia. We are also in communi=\r\ncation with major retailers in the Middle East and Russia, two high-poten=\r\ntial markets in which we \r\nare not yet present.\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Corporate Summary\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  With confidence, we welcome you to Euoko, an exclusive brand that repre=\r\nsents the cornerstone of the most innovative, most unique skin treatments=\r\n. Euoko indeed stands at the intersection of the most noble of commitment=\r\ns to effective active technology, unsurpassed delivery systems, uncomprom=\r\nised service and a modern, understated image.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Our constantly growing library of active principles currently exhibits =\r\n102 ingredients from Switzerland, Spain, France, Canada, Denmark, the Uni=\r\nted States, the Amazonian Rainforest, the Kalahari Desert and Denmark. Fr=\r\nom our most unique hyaluronic acid with no animal origins or strepp bacte=\r\nria derivatives to our recent addition of an extraordinarily effective, a=\r\nge-killing peptide that fully mimics Waglerin 1, a peptide that is found =\r\nin the venom of the Temple Viper, Tropidolaemus wagleri, we stand strongl=\r\ny behind the innovative collection of the noble ingredients found in our =\r\nproducts. Both the safety and effectiveness of our ingredients are import=\r\nant to us. We avoid unnecessary preservation or stabilization and respond=\r\n rapidly to emerging innovations in biotechnology, nanotechnology, biolog=\r\ny, peptides and other active principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Further, our proprietary delivery system ensures maximum stability and =\r\nabsorption of our active principles into the skin. This delivery system i=\r\ns the single key catalyst that maximizes the effectiveness of our princip=\r\nles, while making it possible for high concentrations of our principles t=\r\no be included synergistically in our formulations. Highlights of this sys=\r\ntem include a strain of red marine algae that maximizes penetration of ac=\r\ntives into the skin by causing a controlled immune response when applied =\r\ntopically. This effect is enhanced by the delivery action of our micro-su=\r\nrfactants bound to a pure grade of hyaluronic acid, as well as our unique=\r\n timed-release technology. Every Euoko product embodies Euoko=E2=80=99s c=\r\nommitment to science and quality. When you purchase a Euoko treatment, yo=\r\nu stand confident that your purchase represents the latest scientific dis=\r\ncoveries that are at the forefront of peptide-technology, nanotechnology,=\r\n biotechnology and biology =E2=80=93 a class of confidence unknown even i=\r\nn the highest \r\nclass of skincare.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nDisclosure\r\n\r\nThis e-mail is a paid advertisement from a third party and not the compan=\r\ny and is neither an offer nor recommendation to buy or sell any security.=\r\n The purpose of this advertisement, like any advertising, is to provide p=\r\nublicity for the advertising company, its products or services.
