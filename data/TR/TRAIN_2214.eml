I like the \nfact that each tab has its on process.  If one crashed it does not take the \nwhole browser with it.  I watch a lot of flash videos on hulu, etc and when \nflash crashes or I loose audio from flash all I have to do is terminate the \nflash process from chrome\'s own task manager and restart the video.  I use 2 \nmonitors and when I watch videos on one screen I some time browse the web in \nanother chrome window on the second monitor.  I may have many tabs open which I \ndon\'t want to close just to restart flash when it fails like I would in \nFirefox.  I do use adblock for chrome but I have not seen it do mush for \nblocking adds.\n\n....Bob\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
