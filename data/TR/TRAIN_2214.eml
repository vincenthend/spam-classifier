I like the \r\nfact that each tab has its on process.  If one crashed it does not take the \r\nwhole browser with it.  I watch a lot of flash videos on hulu, etc and when \r\nflash crashes or I loose audio from flash all I have to do is terminate the \r\nflash process from chrome\'s own task manager and restart the video.  I use 2 \r\nmonitors and when I watch videos on one screen I some time browse the web in \r\nanother chrome window on the second monitor.  I may have many tabs open which I \r\ndon\'t want to close just to restart flash when it fails like I would in \r\nFirefox.  I do use adblock for chrome but I have not seen it do mush for \r\nblocking adds.\r\n\r\n....Bob\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
