PDF became a ISO/IEC standard but we (at linux) still lack \r\n> for a PDF editor that can compete with Acrobat Professional.\r\n \r\nIn the GNU/Linux world, being able to edit PDF files is not considered\r\nas a worthwhile feature.  Better edit the file in some other format, and\r\nonly use PDF for a "static output format".
