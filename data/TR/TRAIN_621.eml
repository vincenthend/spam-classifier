I was\nexperiencing disk errors on the drives which caused something in the\nkernel to throw a fit. When this happened, the only recovery I could\nfind was to reboot. This is slow and not really a way to learn how to\nfix the problem. So I ask for advice on this list. I work down the\nlist of suggestions, not having much success, and arrive at\nsmartctl. But now we know that that doesn\'t work for reasons that I\nmight have known if I had read the whole of wikipedia and had total\nrecall --- but I hadn\'t and I don\'t.\n\nSince my last post, I have succeeded in doing a successful, error\nfree, backup to each of the disks. One notable fact about all the\nerrors is that after reboot it would appear that no data was lost and\nthe backup could be resumed from where it advanced to just before the\ncrash. The only thing that I can think that I did differently in these\nnew successful runs is that I did not sit at the computer and\nwatch. Can software detect being watched? I think not, but ...\n\nMy reading about eSATA gives me suspicion that it has its own poorly\ndocumented problems. I\'m not convinced that I cannot make USB work\nwithout S.M.A.R.T, but I really don\'t have any good ideas as to\nhow. And now, without errors happening fairly frequently, I doubt that\nI will be able to test and debug any approach that I dream up.\n\n> \n> The only other realistic option I know of is eSATA, but a quick scan of\n> Newegg shows only 6 devices total, 2 DVR expander drives and 4 eSATA RAID\n> enclosures.

One\ncomputer acts as a collector of backups from the itself and the other\ntwo, and is responsible for getting the files onto an external drive\nin a timely way.\n\nAll of the computers are hand-me-downs. None have eSATA capability. So\nfar I have not convinced myself that spending money would help solve\nthe problem. Perhaps in a few years, computers with eSATA will start\nshowing up in dumpsters. Maybe I should just wait.\n\n-- \nPaul E Condon           \npecondon@mesanetworks.net\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
