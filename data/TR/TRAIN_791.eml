There isn\'t one on this system. I used to \nhate fiddling around with that file. The transition to other means of \ncontrolling video has been fraught with peril for some, but a few false \nstarts with video configuration on this system under various \ndistributions finally convinced me that the voyage needed to be undertaken.\n\n > Cheers,\n > Kelly Clowers\n\nMany thanks for your response.\n\nBest,\nSam\n\nPS: I also sent this message from a different e-mail account. I figured \nI\'d resend it to clear up any question about who was actually responding \nto the thread. Sorry about the dumbness. Too much swapping of systems \nand info around this place.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe". Trouble?
