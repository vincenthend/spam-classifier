There isn\'t one on this system. I used to \r\nhate fiddling around with that file. The transition to other means of \r\ncontrolling video has been fraught with peril for some, but a few false \r\nstarts with video configuration on this system under various \r\ndistributions finally convinced me that the voyage needed to be undertaken.\r\n\r\n > Cheers,\r\n > Kelly Clowers\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your response.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSam\r\n\r\nPS: I also sent this message from a different e-mail account.
