I haven't filed a bug yet because I suspect it's\nbecause I'm still running 5.005 perl because of reported compatibility issues\nwith 5.6 and later, but I probably will because I think there's too much legacy\nperl code to put up with major compatibility problems, and spamassassin didn't,\nat least in the quickest of looks, say it needed a newer one.  The perl @ stuff\nwas bad enough...  but this is all a separate soapbox...\n\n\n\n------- You are receiving this mail because: -------\nYou are the assignee for the bug, or are watching the assignee.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old\ncell phone?
