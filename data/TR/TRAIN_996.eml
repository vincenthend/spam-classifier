Once those CDs were installed, your\ninstallations would be mostly indistinguishable. After the initial\ninstall, Debian grabs the right bits for your system.\n\nWhen I switched from 32-bit to 64-bit, the only difference I saw\nbesides a different installation image was a different kernel.\n\n-- \nBill Wohler <wohler@newt.com> aka <Bill.Wohler@nasa.gov>\nhttp://www.newt.com/wohler/\nGnuPG ID:610BD9AD\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
