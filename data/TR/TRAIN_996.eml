Once those CDs were installed, your\r\ninstallations would be mostly indistinguishable. After the initial\r\ninstall, Debian grabs the right bits for your system.\r\n\r\nWhen I switched from 32-bit to 64-bit, the only difference I saw\r\nbesides a different installation image was a different kernel.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nBill Wohler <wohler@newt.com> aka <Bill.Wohler@nasa.gov>\r\nhttp://www.newt.com/wohler/\r\nGnuPG ID:610BD9AD\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
