My approach \nwould have been just making the \'hold\' action also clear the \'automatically \ninstalled\' flag; essentially "institutionalizing" the temporary solution.  \nBut, I defer to your solution as it sounds more flexible.\n\n$(reportbug -k aptitude)\n-- \nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr.           \t ,= ,-_-. =.\nbss@iguanasuicide.net            \t((_/)o o(\\_))\nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy \t `-\'(. .)`-\'\nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/        \t     \\_/\n', 'subject': 'Re: How to trick my Debian in thinking that a package is not installed'}
