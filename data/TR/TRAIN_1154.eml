My approa=\r\nch=20\r\nwould have been just making the \'hold\' action also clear the \'automatically=\r\n=20\r\ninstalled\' flag; essentially "institutionalizing" the temporary solution. =\r\n=20\r\nBut, I defer to your solution as it sounds more flexible.\r\n\r\n$(reportbug -k aptitude)\r\n=2D-=20\r\nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr.           \t ,=3D ,-_-. =3D.\r\nbss@iguanasuicide.net            \t((_/)o o(\\_))\r\nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy \t `-\'(. .)`-\'\r\nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/        \t     \\_/\r\n', 'subject': 'Re: How to trick my Debian in thinking that a package is not installed'}
