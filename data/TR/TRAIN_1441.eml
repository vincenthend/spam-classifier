I\'ve tried the following:\n\n1. I have no ".xsession-errors" (or ".xession-errors") in my home \ndirectory or that of any other user.\n\n2. It appears the configuration files for kde4 are found under \n"/usr/share/kde4/config" and also "/etc/kde4/kdm/".  I tried moving the \n"config" directory to an obscure location and the doing the "apt-get \ninstall --reinstall kdm".  It regenerated the config directory but no \nchange in login.\n\n3. I found that under /user/bin (when doing the dpkg -L kdm) there is a \nfile "genkdmconf" which looked promising.  Reading the help file for it \nand executing "genkdmconf -no-old", the files under /etc/kde4/kdm were \nbacked up and new ones regenerated.  Now, I get a different login screen \nbackground, but the action is still the same -- does not accept my \npassword.  I can still use the "console login" option of that screen and \nget to the CLI login and doing so still allows me to startx and get \nthings going.\n\nSo it appears that your last paragraph applies.  I\'ll be glad to try \n(almost) anything you or anyone else suggests on this.\n\n(I am also, per my previous message, starting another thread for the \nsymbol not found problem I have in trying to get some applications \nrunning (synaptic, iceape, geany to name a few).)\n\nRegards,\nDon\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
