{'body': "URL: http://boingboing.net/#85485805\nDate: Not supplied\n\nMoller, a public company in Davis, California, has developed a flying car.  \n\n    [IMG: http://www.craphound.com/images/flyingcar.jpg] Moller International \n    has developed the first and only feasible, personally affordable, personal \n    vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) vehicle the world has ever seen. \n\n    You've always known it was just a matter of time before the world demanded \n    some kind of flying machine which would replace the automobile. Of course, \n    this machine would have to be capable of VTOL, be easy to maintain, cost \n    effective and reliable. Well, we at Moller International believe we have \n    come up with the solution. That solution is the volantor named M400 Skycar. \n     \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Mark!_)\n\n[1] http://www.moller.com/skycar/\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/kpP4y4RMJ63SA\n\n\n", 'subject': 'Flying cars here, jetpacks next?'}
