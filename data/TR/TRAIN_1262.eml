And\r\nthe defaults do not have wobbly windows, wavy effects, or anything\r\nshimmering. Nothing spins either, but the Alt-tab dialogue does slide.\r\nThere is plenty of transparency, though, and I hate that too. So I\r\nturn it off.\r\n\r\nMy mother suffers from what she calls "vertigo" and the effects do not\r\nupset her. Nor do they upset the autistics that I volunteer with. They\r\nare merely an annoyance to those annoyed by them, nothing wild.\r\n\r\n\r\n> 2. ctrl+tab does not move to the next window.\r\n\r\nDo you mean between tabs?

That is how I open all my applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n> 4. Alt+F1 does not bring up the menu.\r\n\r\nIt\'s Alt-F5 for the Kmenu. Has been since KDE 3 I think.\r\n\r\n\r\n> 5.
