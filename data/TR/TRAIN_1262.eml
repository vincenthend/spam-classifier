And\nthe defaults do not have wobbly windows, wavy effects, or anything\nshimmering. Nothing spins either, but the Alt-tab dialogue does slide.\nThere is plenty of transparency, though, and I hate that too. So I\nturn it off.\n\nMy mother suffers from what she calls "vertigo" and the effects do not\nupset her. Nor do they upset the autistics that I volunteer with. They\nare merely an annoyance to those annoyed by them, nothing wild.\n\n\n> 2. ctrl+tab does not move to the next window.\n\nDo you mean between tabs? Fixed:\nhttps://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=231541\n\n\n> 3. alt+F2 is cumbersome and unhelpful.

That is how I open all my applications.\n\n\n> 4. Alt+F1 does not bring up the menu.\n\nIt\'s Alt-F5 for the Kmenu. Has been since KDE 3 I think.\n\n\n> 5.
