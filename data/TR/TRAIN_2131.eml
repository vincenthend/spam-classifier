Otherwise, if a file becomes corrupted, \nyou\'ll never know it, unless you keep your own checksums.  There are \nonly a small handful of filesystems that keep checksums of your files.  \nBtrfs and ZFS come to mind.  I believe ZFS is more mature than Btrfs, \nbut it isn\'t in the kernel.  I believe the only way to get ZFS on Linux \nis through FUSE.\n\nThere\'s also JFS, which has been around for a number of years, and is \nmature.  It doesn\'t checksum your files, but it does use copy-on-write \n(as do Btrfs and ZFS), which goes a long way to keeping your data from \ngetting corrupted, something XFS does not do.\n\nSo if Btrfs were more mature, or if ZFS were included in the kernel, I\'d \nrecommend either of those.  But as it is, I think JFS is the way to go.\n\n-- Kevin\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe". Trouble?
