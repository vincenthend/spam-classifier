When those packages someday get upgraded,\nthey overwrite what the nvidia driver installed, and then things break.\nI have helped enough people fix that kind of mess to know.\n\nJust a simple fact.  Overwriting packages owned by a package is always\na bad idea no matter how it is done, because someday the package will\noverwrite it back on you.\n\n> What tricked me yesterday: Why don\'t I get the 2.6.32-4 kernel that\n> works with the 195.36.15 Nvidia driver although I have\n> linux-image-2.6-amd64 installed?

It should always be up to date in\nstable though.  I have never quite figured out how the kernel packagers\ndecide when to update it.\n\n> And no, please no flaming, I have no intention to provoke someone.

My wife thought\nit was rather unfriendly that her last upgrade (which gave her a new\nkernel) took away X.  Sure recompiling the module with module-assistant\nwas easy, but it had to be done manually.  I will see if I can\'t find\na way to automate that for those users that want it.\n\n> > i.e. edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf -remove \'nivida\' and replace with \'nv\'\n> > very handy when the compile fails.\n> > and it will.\n> \n> Oh yes. ;-)\n\nSometimes it does. :)\n\nAlso the nvidia installer for a long time hasn\'t worked with debian\'s\n2.6.29 and higher kernels because they are now kbuild only (and hence\ndon\'t allow compiler tests that the nvidia installer used to work unless\nthey get converted to kbuild).  I am not sure if it works with it yet.\nThose running their own kernels would of course never notice that problem\nsince they have the full sources installed the way the nvidia makefiles\nassumed it would be.  This same kernel header change also turned vmware\nmodules into a nightmare as well as a few other out of kernel drivers.\n\n-- \nLen Sorensen\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
