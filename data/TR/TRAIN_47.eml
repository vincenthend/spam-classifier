{'body': b" I decided to try out GarGnome, to see what gnome2 looks like. It's\npretty, I'll give it that.\n\n However, there seemed to be loads of bugs - sawfish threw wobblers all\nover the place, so I tryed out metacity - which doesn't have a GUI\nconfigurator, and arsed if I'm going back to the fvwm days when you had to\nset settings by hand, without an idea what the values looked like.\n\n So, I went back to 1.4 - and now sawfish can't start applets (yes, I did\nchange the LD_LIBRARY_PATH back) and the panel can't make new workspaces.\n\n Any ideas what could have happened ? Would sawfish 2.0 silently change\nthe config files & break them?\n\nKate\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n", 'subject': '[ILUG] gargnome & sawfish..'}
