{'body': b'Quoting Paul Linehan (plinehan@yahoo.com):\n\n> I\'m confused.

Some are under the GNU GPL.  Many are not.  Are\nyou clear on this point, now?  This is my second try.  One suspects that\nyou actually understand perfectly, but just don\'t like it.\n\nYou\'re further confused if you think the GNU GPL gives you the right to\nget covered software for free.  It does not.  It provides that _if_\nyou\'ve lawfully received a copy of the covered binary version, you have\nrights to also receive the matching source code.\n\n> I don\'t particularly need support, so I\'m not really interested in\n> purchasing a set of disks with 4 billion apps which I\'ll never use.\n\nThen, if you nonetheless want a SuSE boxed set\'s contents, the only way\nyou can do that without copyright violation _and_ without having to pay\nthe purchase price is to get someone to _give_ (not "lend" or duplicate) \nyou his copy.\n\n> Yes, thanks for your input. Anyway, I\'ve a friend with 7.3 pro, so\n> I\'ll just ask him.\n\nAsk him _what_?  If you\'re asking him to "lend" or duplicate his CDs,\nthen you\'ll be ripping off SuSE Linux AG illegally.\n\nDon\'t like SuSE\'s product licensing?  Write your own distribution.  You\ncan even grab most of what you need _from SuSE_.  All you have to do is \nheed the licensing terms on the individual pieces.\n\nWhat, you think that\'s too much work?  Then, try a different\ndistribution.  Clue:  _Not_ one packaged in a retail boxed set.  Even RH\n7.3 retail boxed sets include non-freely redistributable applications on\nthe Star office 5.2 CD and the Productivity Applications CD, among\nothers.  (The core 3-CD set of the basic RH distribution, on the other\nhand, contains only software that may be freely redistributed, whether \nopen source or not.)\n\n-- \nHi! I\'m a .signature virus!
