{'body': b'Hi everybody,\n\nPlease, CC: me, as I am not subscribed to the list.\n\nI am running Debian sid on an Apple iMac 27", with a Mobility Radeon HD\n4850 video card (ATI Technologies Inc M98L). The kernel I use is\n2.6.33-2 from experimental, and I have disable KMS.\n\nDepending on the version of the radeon driver I use, I see or not\nsomething on the screen:\n\n- with 1:6.12.192-2, everything startx correctly when I launch startx\n  from the command line.\n- with 1:6.13.0-1, the screen becomes black, and it is impossible to go\n  back to a console using Alt+Ctl+F?. However, I can ssh to the system,\n  and see using ps that the KDE session has indeed started.\n\nHere are in attachment the two logs: failed is with 6.13, and success is\nwith 6.12.192.\n\nHas someone an idea of what is going on? Is there an option I could add\nto my (at the moment empty) xorg.conf to remedy this problem?\n\nBest regards,\n\n\tC\xe9dric\n', 'subject': 'black screen when starting X on radeon HD4850 with\n xserver-xorg-video-radeon 1:6.13'}
