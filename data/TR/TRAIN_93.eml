No, not Hugo van der Sanden, who\nhopefully everyone knows is taking on the task of 5.9 and 5.10. No, I\'m\ntalking about the inimitable Michael Schwern, who\'s now holder of the\nperl 1 pumpkin and, I\'m assured, is well on the way to a new maintenance\nrelease. Details are over on [1]dev.perl.org. Join the porters list and\nhelp Schwern out!" Yes, he said "perl 1".\n\nDiscuss this story at:\n    http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=02/07/30/2016230\n\nLinks:\n    0. http://yetanother.org/dan/\n    1. http://dev.perl.org/perl1/\n\n\n\nCopyright 1997-2002 pudge.
