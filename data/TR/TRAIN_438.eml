{'body': 'Has anyone tried it with the 10M3050 or 9M3150 developer preview? I\'m somewhat concerned that this is a demonstrable regression between Java 5 and Java 6 - however there are several other factors that can impact memory use:\n\n- 32 vs. 64-bit (biggest culprit)\n- 1.5/client/32-bit tuned garbage collection options running on 1.6/server/64-bit\n- client vs. server HotSpot itself (more aggressive compilation and storage of compiled code)\n\nAnecdotally, I\'ve talked to several people who have large long running 64-bit processes on Snow Leopard with 2GB-of-RAM machines who were having a miserable time. While reverting to 32-bit may be a quick fix for some, others who tuned the GC parameters or turned on -XX:+UseCompressedOops (which compresses Java references to 32-bit values in the heap) found that they could reclaim or even exceed their original 32-bit performance (since they were still using the server JVM).\n\nSince someone mentioned that NetBeans 6.9 Beta was working well, I\'d suggest taking a look at it\'s JVM options and see if there wasn\'t some tweaking done to optimize it for a 64-bit by default world.\n\nBest of luck,\nMike Swingler\nJava Runtime Engineer\nApple Inc.\n\nOn Apr 23, 2010, at 7:06 AM, Dave Minnigerode wrote:\n\n> I too have been using netbeans 6.8 on 10.5 and 10.6 with the default jvm doing java 6 work... It\'s just stable enough for daily use.  I do restart NB every few hrs when the memory use gets out of hand (apparently some object leaks with the apple jvm/nb combo).... can\'t switch it back to java 5, so kinda stuck with it. So I\'m probably just going to switch to IntilliJ, I\'ve found it\'s performance to be a lot better than NB overall.

I\'m using the late 2006 Macbook Pro (2.33 GHz upgraded to 4 GB [3.5 GB] RAM). I\'m using the latest Java through Software Update, and my app is Swing-based (using Matisse) and using the Swing Application Framework with an embedded Derby database, though I will note that I have issues even before any files are open. Just expanding the tree to get to a file for opening tended to take about 10 seconds, and that\'s assuming I didn\'t switch to another window in the meantime.\n>> \n>> I just did a full wipe/reinstall of Netbeans to see if my settings were a problem, but I had no change until I loaded in Java 5 and saw a significant difference.

I watch CPU activity since I had an issue with Kernel panics a month ago.  Turned out to be a combination of a failing disk drive and a memory stick. Replaced the 160G drive with 500G and the 2G stick with 4G (to make total of 6G).

From what I understand, there\'s some issue with Snow Leopard and Java 6 that makes Netbeans 6.8 near unusable. (I\'ve had to do my development on a lesser-powered PC because there, things will actually open without pegging the CPU at 100% and becoming unresponsive.) Following a tip, I used Pacifist to reinstall Leopard\'s Java 5 back onto the system, set it as the default, and tried to launch Netbeans. Lo and behold, it was fast, responsive and showed none of the problems I\'d been used to. Unfortunately, it made it so that I couldn\'t work on my Java 6-based app!\n>>> \n>>>> \n>>> \n>>>> So, what is the actual situation here? Is this a known issue with the Apple JVM that\'s (hopefully) going to get fixed? Is this a bug in Netbeans? Am I the only one seeing issues this bad, and so it could be a problem with my setup? Is there a workaround? Any help would be vastly appreciated -- the Windows box is having disk issues, and I\'d love to move my primary development to the Macbook Pro as soon as possible. And if push comes to shove, I may have to just rearchitect the project into Java 5 (which would not be a simple task.)\n>>> \n>>>> _______________________________________________\n>>> \n>>>> Do not post admin requests to the list.
