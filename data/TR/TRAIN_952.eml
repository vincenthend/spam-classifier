I wasn\'t trying to imply the same exact code has been\naround for 17 years.  Hell if that was the case I wouldn\'t be using it.\nWhilst the initial Linux porting effort was more than a simple recompile, I\ndon\'t believe it was a herculanean effort.  Far more changes to the XFS code\nhave been made since inclusion in mainline than the changes required to get\nfrom IRIX to Linux.\n\nI actually saw a brief video interview of one of the SGI IRIX devs quite\nsome time ago in which he described the initial Linux port effort to get it\nrunning on SGI\'s big Origin 3000 MIPS machines.  They had to do this to\nstart validating how everything would run under Linux because they didn\'t\nhave the first Itanium Altix systems manufactured yet.\n\nIIRC their testbed was a 32 processor Origin 3000 running MIPS R14K\nprocessors.  This was back before the Linux MIPS port project existed so\nthey were in essence creating the first Linux MIPS port as part of their\neffort.  He clearly stated that developing/maintaining a Linux MIPS port was\nnot in the cards for SGI, that this effort was strictly a validation effort.\n He said it took about a week to get Linux booting on the Origin system, and\nanother week to get it stable.  The first XFS port to Linux was part of this\neffort.  If it took only 2 weeks for the bulk of this effort, I can\'t\nimagine they had to modify a ton of XFS code.  IRIX was written in C as is\nLinux, so the changes in XFS were probably fairly minor.\n\nI\'d venture to guess that the most significant Linux XFS changes were those\nfor the 32bit X86 code base.  IRIX and thus XFS were born on 64bit MIPS RISC\nCPUs.  Moving that to a Linux 64bit Itanium environment was probably\nrelatively straight forward.  Moving down to a 32bit platform probably\nrequired a lot of code changes, as did the initial Linux 64bit ports up to\nAlpha, HPPA, Itanium, and eventually MIPS64.\n\n-- \nStan\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
