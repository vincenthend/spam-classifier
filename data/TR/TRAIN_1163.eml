It attempts to invoke the prerm \nscripts of a perl module.  That fails due to not being able to find \n'File/Basename.pm', which causes dpkg to fail the --remove action with error \ncode 1.  apt-get then stops the install run.\n\nAptitude might get further than apt-get, but the prerm of the perl module is \ngoing to keep failing until perl is fixed.\n-- \nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr.           \t ,= ,-_-. =.\nbss@iguanasuicide.net            \t((_/)o o(\\_))\nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy \t `-'(. .)`-'\nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/        \t     \\_/\n", 'subject': "Re: apt-get dist-update failure - can't boot"}
