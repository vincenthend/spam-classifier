It attempts to invoke the pr=\r\nerm=20\r\nscripts of a perl module.  That fails due to not being able to find=20\r\n\'File/Basename.pm\', which causes dpkg to fail the --remove action with erro=\r\nr=20\r\ncode 1.  apt-get then stops the install run.\r\n\r\nAptitude might get further than apt-get, but the prerm of the perl module i=\r\ns=20\r\ngoing to keep failing until perl is fixed.\r\n=2D-=20\r\nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr.           \t ,=3D ,-_-. =3D.\r\nbss@iguanasuicide.net            \t((_/)o o(\\_))\r\nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy \t `-\'(. .)`-\'\r\nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/        \t     \\_/\r\n', 'subject': "Re: apt-get dist-update failure - can't boot"}
