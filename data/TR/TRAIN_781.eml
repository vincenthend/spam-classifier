Thanks - John\n\nI had this problem with 64-bit Ubuntu for a long time. Finally, when\nAdobe was working on the 9.x release I inquired directly to Adobe. The\nresult was that I became a beta tester. And the outcome was that Adobe\nfixed Reader 9.1 so that I could see my printers.\n\nI have not had the problem since. I suggest getting the latest version\nof Reader. Version 8.1.7 is really old anyway.\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe". Trouble?
