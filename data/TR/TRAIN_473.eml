{'body': 'At Fermi (yes I\'m back there; long story), we\'re buying 4U systems like \nthe fiscal year is ending.  We have ~20 ASA IR4US1 systems (not pushing \nthem, there are some other similar units available), with 60 more on \norder.  They\'re 2-1/2 TB for $10K, although we add a separate IDE or \nSCSI system disk, because the 3Ware RAID controllers can saturate. \nIntel SDS2 motherboard, 2 1.4GHz P3s, 2 GB ram, 2 3Ware 7850 Raid \ncontrollers, 16 160GB Maxtors, SysKonnect gigabit enet, Fermi RedHat 7.3.\n\nhttp://www.asacomputers.com/cgi-bin/index.fcg?action=displayscreen&templateid=25\n\nThere\'s some interesting info at:\n\nhttp://mit.fnal.gov/~msn/cdf/caf/server_evaluation.html\n\nWe\'ve decided to go with XFS (which Linus has just merged into the 2.5 \ntree), mostly because none of the other journaled fs\'s can maintain >30 \nGB/s rates with a nearly full filesystem (mostly GB files) with random \ndeletions (we use these systems for caching our 2 petabyte tape store). \n  Ext3 almost did it but dropped from from ~38MB/s to 10 with random \ndeletions, and didn\'t want to do direct io at all.  Only concern is an \noccasional system lock-up we haven\'t chased down yet.  A load avg > 100 \nis always a patio of fun.\n\nOddly, even fairly beefy systems like these will breathe hard to keep up \nwith the new STK 9940B tape drives, which crank along at a steady \n30GB/s.  And you oldforktimers will remember "doofus" my old file server \nsystem.  It would only take 2.1" of rackspace now, instead of 14 racks.\n\nCheers,\nWayne\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: storage bits'}
