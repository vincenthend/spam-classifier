It\'s in the same\nredhat/linux/beta/limbo directory on the ftp servers. Just check the\nredhat-release package to find out which version is on the server. \nLooking at ftp.redhat.com, the current one is redhat-release-7.3.93-2.\n\nIf you\'re using GNOME2 from the beta, I\'d upgrade as there were some\nimportant bugfixes since the first beta. The only thing to watch out\nfor is that Limbo2 switched gcc to 3.2, which is once again\nincompatible with the previous gcc (v3.1 shipped in Limbo1).\n\ngary\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n', 'subject': 'Re: Limbo beta 2 ?'}
