{'body': 'Yes, it is very impressive.  However, all of the most advanced content\nfiltering known to man is easily defeated by simply presenting the content\nin the form of a graphic image (GIF, JPG, etc.).  I\'m surprised that more\nspammers don\'t already do this.  I know we have discussed this before, and\nmaybe we can detect this type of spam via the headers and with Razor/DCC (if\nyou\'re using them).  But that sure narrows down the ruleset (maybe that\'s\ngood).\n\nMTodd\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: yyyy@spamassassin.taint.org [mailto:yyyy@spamassassin.taint.org]\nSent: Friday, August 16, 2002 12:52 PM\nTo: SpamAssassin-talk@example.sourceforge.net\nSubject: [SAtalk] paulgraham.com article\n\n\nQuite interesting -- it\'s pretty similar to the spam phrases stuff.
