I'll never understand.\n\nHow hot it feels is affected by both temperature and humidity.  In \nMississippi they have lots of humidity, in the Southwest, we don't.\n\nAs I know from experience, Mississippi feels a lot hotter at 90 degrees F. \nthan home (Santa Fe) does at 90.\n\nPerhaps the military didn't want to train in a real desert because 1) it \nget's over 100 degrees and any time the air temp is greater than body temp \nit affects performance, and 2) when those troops go to a real desert \nthey'll think it's so much nicer than Mississippi.\n\nNo, I'm not maligning Mississippi.  I had a great time passing through last \nyear on vacation.\n\nPeace,\n\nMarty Halvorson\nmarty@halvorson.us\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n", 'subject': "Re: What's cool about doing nothing"}
