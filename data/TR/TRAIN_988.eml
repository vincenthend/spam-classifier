{'body': "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to create an empty QTMovie object that I can add segments to, \r\nand then play. This is easy to do with something like:\r\n\r\nmovie = [[QTMovie alloc] initToWritableData:[NSMutableData \r\ndataWithCapacity:1048576] error:&error];\r\n\r\nI can then use -insertSegmentOfMovie to insert segments from other \r\nmovies into this one so I can play it back. The problem is that I also \r\nneed to set a certain attribute when creating the QTMovie object. In \r\nparticular, I need to set the QTMovieRateChangesPreservePitchAttribute \r\nattribute, so that I can alter playback speed during playback without \r\nchanging pitch. This attribute cannot be written after the movie is \r\ninitialized.\r\n\r\nSo, I can create the QTMovie object like this:\r\n\r\nmovie = [[QTMovie alloc] initWithAttributes:[NSDictionary \r\ndictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:[NSNumber numberWithBool:YES], \r\nQTMovieRateChangesPreservePitchAttribute, nil] error:&error];\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is not editable. I've tried setting the \r\nQTMovieEditableAttribute as well on creation, but it does not help. I \r\nstill get an exception when I try to insert anything into this movie. I \r\npresume this is because there is no writable file or data reference \r\nassociated with the QTMovie.\r\n\r\nAny ideas on how to solve this?\r\n\r\nThanks very much,\r\nChad Sellers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChad Sellers\r\nUseful Fruit Software\r\nhttp://www.usefulfruit.com/\r\n _______________________________________________\r\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
