{'body': "Hello all,\n\nI'm trying to create an empty QTMovie object that I can add segments to, \nand then play. This is easy to do with something like:\n\nmovie = [[QTMovie alloc] initToWritableData:[NSMutableData \ndataWithCapacity:1048576] error:&error];\n\nI can then use -insertSegmentOfMovie to insert segments from other \nmovies into this one so I can play it back. The problem is that I also \nneed to set a certain attribute when creating the QTMovie object. In \nparticular, I need to set the QTMovieRateChangesPreservePitchAttribute \nattribute, so that I can alter playback speed during playback without \nchanging pitch. This attribute cannot be written after the movie is \ninitialized.\n\nSo, I can create the QTMovie object like this:\n\nmovie = [[QTMovie alloc] initWithAttributes:[NSDictionary \ndictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:[NSNumber numberWithBool:YES], \nQTMovieRateChangesPreservePitchAttribute, nil] error:&error];\n\nUnfortunately, this is not editable. I've tried setting the \nQTMovieEditableAttribute as well on creation, but it does not help. I \nstill get an exception when I try to insert anything into this movie. I \npresume this is because there is no writable file or data reference \nassociated with the QTMovie.\n\nAny ideas on how to solve this?\n\nThanks very much,\nChad Sellers\n\n\n\n\nChad Sellers\nUseful Fruit Software\nhttp://www.usefulfruit.com/\n _______________________________________________\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
