According to the Foxconn article in the Wikipedia\r\nFoxconn was forced by some of the companies which used Foxconn boards in\r\ntheir own brands to fix those BIOSes.  In any event if the information\r\nin that article is even half true, Foxconn is a manufacturer to avoid.\r\n\r\n<snip>\r\n\r\n> Intel chipsets make sense for Intel Motherboards, the days when you\r\n> needed to look to Via or someone else to provide the needed features\r\n> are mostly gone (Nvidia is, for now, still the best for more powerful\r\n> integrated graphics with Intel CPUs.

The model I was originally looking at was a GA-G31M-ES2L for\r\nCA$59.00.  I found however a GA-EP43-UD3L with the ICH10 and many other\r\nmore advanced features including better Realtek audio for CA$83.00.  As\r\nI am using an external GPU which GPU internal chipset is provided is not\r\nreally an issue for me. I think the latter model is better value for the\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nRegards, Ken Heard\r\n\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v2.0.9 (GNU/Linux)\r\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\r\n\r\niEYEARECAAYFAkvPwf4ACgkQlNlJzOkJmTfrCACggUeE10NsliUzCLAH/s4lXqTS\r\nVW8An0dPH6RXXTTF5f5zOAGUfto4lKh5\r\n=IwK/\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
