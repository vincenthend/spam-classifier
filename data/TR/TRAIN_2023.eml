{'body': 'This is not an exmh problem, but an interaction between sendmail, Solaris and \nmh.\n\nYour sysadmin is wrong.  It is the responsibility of the receiving mail \nserver to escape lines beginning with "From " if they choose to turn on that \nfacility.  It is not the responsibility for email clients to cater to the \nstupid design of the unix mail spool, and Sun\'s even more stupid decision to \nrely on "Content-length:" instead of dealing with this problem.  Since mh is \nunaware of "Content-length:", rcvstore gags trying to parse messages from the \nspool.\n\nI had this same problem.  There are several ways to fix it:\n\n1)  Get your mail administrator to add the "E" flag to your sendmail.  This \nmeans you will never see a line beginning with "From ".  Any such line will \nlook like ">From ".\n\n2)  There is a patch to mh to make it respect "Content-length:".  When I was \nhaving this problem, porting this patch to nmh was low on the priority list, \nthen nmh development stalled for a long time.  I doubt it has been done, but \nyou can check with the nmh list at nmh-workers@mhost.com to find out for sure.\n\n3)  You can learn to use procmail, invoking rcvstore directly instead of \nletting sendmail put your incoming mail into the spool.  This avoids the \nwhole issue.  rcvstore only deals with a single message at a time, and \neverything works.\n-- \nJim McMaster\nmailto:mcmasjc@tatanka.stortek.com\n\n\nIn message <200210091657.g99GvDmX025433@life.ai.mit.edu>, Jason Rennie said:\n> \n> When I receive a message that has a line starting with "From ", it\'s\n> broken into two messages.
