{'body': b'Package: bbkeys\nVersion: 0.9.0-7.1\nSeverity: normal\n\nI am not shure if this is for bbkeys or blacbox!\nWhen I run any java program I am not able to switch to it by bbkeys\nbinding that work for every other program just fine.\nIn my ~/.bbkeysrc I have:\n\n    [NextWindow]      (Mod4-Tab)\n    [PrevWindow]      (Mod4-Shift-Tab)\n    [nextWorkspace]   (Mod4-Control-Tab)\n    [prevWorkspace]   (Mod4-Control-Shift-Tab)\n\nand it work. It is just java programs are not included in \'Switch to...\'\nwindow that pops up. To be more concrete I just downloaded \nOmegaT_2.1.5_Beta_Linux.tar.bz2 from http://www.omegat.org and this\njava program (nor any other window that it create) does not appear in\n\'Switch to...\' list. When I click with mouse on the arrow in the\nblackbox toolbar it does cycle all opened windows on workspace\n(including java programs).\n\nMartin\n\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
