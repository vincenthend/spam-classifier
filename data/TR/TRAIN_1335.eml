{'body': 'Package: bbkeys\r\nVersion: 0.9.0-7.1\r\nSeverity: normal\r\n\r\nI am not shure if this is for bbkeys or blacbox!\r\nWhen I run any java program I am not able to switch to it by bbkeys\r\nbinding that work for every other program just fine.\r\nIn my ~/.bbkeysrc I have:\r\n\r\n    [NextWindow]      (Mod4-Tab)\r\n    [PrevWindow]      (Mod4-Shift-Tab)\r\n    [nextWorkspace]   (Mod4-Control-Tab)\r\n    [prevWorkspace]   (Mod4-Control-Shift-Tab)\r\n\r\nand it work. It is just java programs are not included in \'Switch to...\'\r\nwindow that pops up. To be more concrete I just downloaded \r\nOmegaT_2.1.5_Beta_Linux.tar.bz2 from http://www.omegat.org and this\r\njava program (nor any other window that it create) does not appear in\r\n\'Switch to...\' list. When I click with mouse on the arrow in the\r\nblackbox toolbar it does cycle all opened windows on workspace\r\n(including java programs).\r\n\r\nMartin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \r\nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
