{'body': 'Normally, I disdain any kind of mysticism, even when it is associated \nwith fairly good ideas.  Just a big turnoff.  A good example would be \nthe difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but \nrelated, relaxation techniques including "betagenics", \nhypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics I \nobsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo / \nG-Force Dyno-Staff.\n\nI have to say however that, having found this while looking for \nsomething completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  I \nparticularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, the \nMindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.\n\nTo my internal ear, nearly all of these 60\'s based new-age vernacular \nseem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60\'s?) who needs some \nreligion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize.  Very \nirritating, but taken in small doses it\'s interesting to compare and \ncontrast with our (my) modern mental models.\n\nI found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and \njustify US/UN foreign policy and actions.\n\nhttp://mindprod.com/methods.html\nhttp://members.aol.com/inossence/Kenkey.html\nhttp://www.mindprod.com/\n(Apologies for the embedded HTML.)\n\nWe create the world we live in.\nA loving person lives in a loving world,\nA hostile person lives in a hostile world.\nEveryone you meet is your mirror.\n\nYou make yourself and others suffer just as much when you take offence \nas when you give offence.
