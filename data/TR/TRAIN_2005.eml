{'body': '\nThe way to debug something like this is to turn on the log (Preferences \n-> Hacking Support -> Debug log enabled) and track the gpg commands \nbeing issued and the responses.\n\nFWIW, using exmh 2.5 and gpg 1.0.7 I do not have problems sending \nencrypted messages to myself. When I select the message, an xterm \nwindow pops up asking for the passphrase. I don\'t recall exmh ever \nasking me for the passphrase from the tty that started exmh nor from a \ndialog box. (But then again, I\'m not a heavy gpg user).\n\nKevin\n\nIn message <200209111917.PAA02912@blackcomb.panasas.com>, Brent Welch writes:\n> Hmm - I\'m cc\'ing the exmh-workers list, because I really don\'t know\n> much about the various PGP interfaces.
