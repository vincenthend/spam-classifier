As far as I know 'anyone in the know' would  \nhave to be Apple or the originator to view that radar.\nYou don't indicate the situation where you run into the bug. Have you  \nconsidered using anything besides Sun java.util.zip?\nThis for one turned up quickly looking for (googling)\njava.util.zipfile compatible\n\nA pure java implementation of the java.util.zip library\n\nhttp://jazzlib.sourceforge.net/\n\nwhich in turns mentions jzlib which I think I looked at before.\n\nI support some of my own zip related code but not really compatible  \nto ZipFile. Not doing much with it. Plan to probably return to it  \nsometime after 1.7 provides the long awaited pluggable filesystems.\n\n\n\nMike Hall        hallmike at att dot net\nhttp://www195.pair.com/mik3hall\nhttp://www195.pair.com/mik3hall/home.html\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/macnative\n\n\n\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG/MacGPG2 v2.0.14 (Darwin)\n\niJwEAQECAAYFAkvxrnoACgkQUvk/ZSaThTJfngQAoxT26sLpgycWm4GW9WeJcZjm\nqAioJBNGBP0+SQ+oVrEsBAuTTjYgXzcE9uZL0ety4BcEjVfTYY2MDF5qsEVfwqjD\njoLVzmjL9LSbICBE4vRA3dST32TFKgVGzFiTCXf6ryIoduclBjEAw2dbSH2mIWH6\n5Txgk5+GCS96VwaVFhM=\n=9UWL\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n _______________________________________________\nDo not post admin requests to the list.
