It also increases the pin\npriority to 990.  aptitude\'s resolver tries particularly hard to install\nthe default package version, and it will tie-break using the priority\n(you can configure both those behaviors extensively, but those are the\ndefaults).  The story is more extreme with the apt resolver: it won\'t\neven consider anything but the default version of a package.\n\n  See also apt_preferences(5), section "APT\'s default priority\nassignments"; "-t" is the same as setting Default-Release.\n\n  Daniel\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
