{'body': 'Hi,\n\nOn my netbook I\'m using automatic USB sticks mount through udev rules,\nand I already used to running \'sync\' command before unplugging stick,\nso no data will be lost. But if I have few sticks inserted and some\ninformation copying on one of them, if I run \'sync\' I have to wait\nwhile copying ends, because:\n\na) sync command drops cache on disk, but copying process fill it\nagain; sync will work until all the caches are dropped to disks\nb) I can\'t unplug stick when it stops to flash because I can\'t be sure\nthat there are no more parts of cache needed to be flushed on that\ndisk.\n\nSo here is my question - how can I run sync for only one device?\n\nWith best regards,\nAlexander Batischev\n\n\n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of "unsubscribe".
