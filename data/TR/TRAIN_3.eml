But how?\n\nBonding is not suitable for you because it works too low-level (it is \nlayer 2), unless you have two links from the same provider, using some \ntechnology that can be bonded (like ADSL).\n\nAFAIU what you need is BGP[1], but I can't give you any tips as this is \nway out of my league ;)\n\nProbably a good start (whatever technology you end up using) is a \nGNU/Linux (preferably Debian) machine connected to both internet links \nand your internal network since consumer gateways don't even have more \nthan one WAN port[2].\n\n[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol\n[2] some of them could be used for this with custom firmware, but this \nis off-topic\n\nRegards,\nAndrei\nP.S.
