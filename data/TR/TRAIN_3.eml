But how?\r\n\r\nBonding is not suitable for you because it works too low-level (it is=20\r\nlayer 2), unless you have two links from the same provider, using some=20\r\ntechnology that can be bonded (like ADSL).\r\n\r\nAFAIU what you need is BGP[1], but I can't give you any tips as this is=20\r\nway out of my league ;)\r\n\r\nProbably a good start (whatever technology you end up using) is a=20\r\nGNU/Linux (preferably Debian) machine connected to both internet links=20\r\nand your internal network since consumer gateways don't even have more=20\r\nthan one WAN port[2].\r\n\r\n[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol\r\n[2] some of them could be used for this with custom firmware, but this=20\r\nis off-topic\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAndrei\r\nP.S.
